# Frame interpolation

Code: `src/recomp/interp.cpp` (tapes, tag keys, pairing, blending, test mode, judder detector),
`src/recomp/tags.cpp` (the game's draw entry points that open tag scopes), `src/recomp/interp_vtx.cpp`
(draw identities, vertex-array copies, CPU-built vertices), `src/recomp/interp_tex.cpp` (texture and
TLUT copies), `src/recomp/shadows.cpp` (LM: camera source, shadow light), `src/recomp/frame.cpp` (decoupled
guest, target frame rate, pacing), hooks in `src/recomp/hle_gx.cpp`, Aurora patches
`0005-capture-and-replay`, `0021-replay-state-slots`, `0028-replay-copy-generations`, `0030-interp-fades`. Background and the original design: docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md section 3.

## Setting

F1 > Visuals > **Frame rate**: a slider from 30 to 320 fps, plus **Match display refresh
rate** (greys the slider out and uses the refresh rate of the display the window is on, queried
through SDL3 every 0.5 s, so moving the window to another monitor follows it).

- **30** is the game's own rate, drawn directly in lockstep (exactly the old "Original 30").
- **Above 30** the guest is decoupled and every game frame is captured into a tape; the host
  presents at the target and replays the newest tape with its moving values blended toward the
  previous tape's. The game still runs at 30 Hz; the picture is one game frame (33 ms) behind.
- settings.ini: `[video] target_fps=<30..320>`, `match_display_refresh=true|false`. The old
  `frame_rate` key is migrated on load: 0 -> 30, 1 -> 60, 2 (unlimited) -> match display.
- Pacing (`frame::pace`): the host loop sleeps (SDL_DelayPrecise) to the target. With VSync on
  and a target at or above the refresh rate the swap chain paces instead, so the frame rate is
  the refresh rate; the menu says "(VSync limits this to N fps)" and the tooltip explains it.

## Tagged interpolation (interp-tagged, October 2026)

The heuristic pairing of the earlier passes (record two game frames' GX streams, then guess which
draw of frame a is which draw of frame b by mesh, vertex layout, colour, order or nearest position)
produced a new class of bug with every fix: identical instances swapping (doors, vases), a reused
light slot tinting the whole picture yellow, HUD quads mixing up, particles swapping partners. It is
replaced by **source-tagged** interpolation, as in Zelda 64: Recompiled / RT64: the game's own draw
code labels what it draws, and the interpolator pairs strictly by that label. Nothing is guessed.

Kept from before (unrelated to pairing): tapes (capture and replay of a game frame's GX stream with
substituted values), vertex-array / texture copies, the replay state slots and copy generations,
camera factoring and the rigid (polar) blend, shadow-receiver rebuilding, frame pacing and
presentation (pacing.cpp, VRR cap, governor, present timing 0197/0216, keep-warm 0215), the shader
precache, vertex snapshots at draw time, Original 30 (no capture). Removed: nearest/mutual/range-scan
pairing, layout groups, swarm handling, colour pairing, fade-ins/outs (Aurora 0030 is no longer used),
blink detection, second-chance pairing by source address or display-list content.

### Identity

`interp::pushTag(category, object, type, sub)` / `popTag` (interp.h; `TagScope` for C++ scopes) open
a scope around something the game draws. Scopes nest; a scope's identity is

  hash(parent scope, category, object address, type, sub, generation(object), occurrence)

- *object*: the guest address of the thing (actor, model instance, J3D packet, furniture object,
  particle, J2D pane);
- *type*: what it is (model data, a constant per hook);
- *sub*: a part index (node, mesh, joint, pass);
- *generation*: bumped when the object's memory is freed (`free__10JKRExpHeapFPv`: every tagged
  address in the freed block) or a pool slot is handed out again (particle link/unlink, particle
  birth stamps below), so a new object at a reused address is never its predecessor;
- *occurrence*: the n-th scope with that identity under the same parent in this game frame (an
  object drawn twice in one view).

Every value the GX HLE notes (position/normal/texture matrix, projection, GX light, CPU-built vertex
block) gets a **key** = hash(innermost object scope, kind, GX call site (the guest return address of
the GX call), its occurrence for that scope/kind/site); GX lights add the light object's address and
slot. Values noted outside any object scope are **untagged** (key 0), except GX lights (the game's
light object is its own tag) and projections (keyed by the camera's structural scope).

Cameras: the view matrix is sampled at every noted value (`viewMatrixSource`, the game camera's GX
view matrix); a view's key is its structural (View) scope path + pass + the order of distinct
cameras in that path. Views pair by key.

### Pairing and policies (`pairTapes`, `replayPair`)

A value of game frame b pairs with the value of frame a that has the same key and the same shape
(kind, size). Ambiguous keys (twice in one frame) are never paired. Then:

| category | what is blended |
|---|---|
| View (structural) | the camera: rotation slerped, eye moved in a straight line |
| World (map rooms) | only the camera: b's world matrices under the in-between camera |
| Object (characters, furniture, props, J3D) | model and normal matrices, rigidly (rotation slerp, scale/shear, translation) in world space under the blended camera; texture matrices; GX lights (position linear, direction slerped, by light object) |
| Particle | the particle's matrices / CPU-built quad positions, by emitter + particle identity (+ birth stamp) |
| Effect (CPU-built geometry of an object) | vertex positions, only with the same vertex count (topology) |
| Hud (2D) | 2D matrices (a jump > 96 px switches) |
| untagged | nothing: b's values, placed under the in-between camera when in the 3D view (else as captured) |

- Colours (channel ambient/material colours 0x100A-0x100D, light colours, TEV colour and konst
  registers 0xE0-0xE7, fog colour 0xF2, also from display lists) and the direct vertex colours of
  CPU-built blocks are blended between values with the identical tag (noteColors: Kind::Color, one
  tape word each) when the draw they belong to pairs with its partner's draw by its own matrices or
  vertices (a colour set in a helper the item loop calls has no item tag and would pair with another
  item's). 2D/HUD colours blend under the same draw check since f45cd1e (static HUD colours blend
  to themselves; the HUD fading in with a room stepped at 30 Hz). 2D immediate-mode quads with direct
  positions and direct RGB(A)8 vertex colours (HUD fades, full-screen fade quads) are noted as 2D
  blocks (role 2, `posBytes2D`): their colours blend while every vertex position is byte-identical
  in both game frames, or while the picture's layout animates (positions blended too: "Text boxes"
  below; text boxes are replayed as one layout: "Text boxes at 120"); untagged ones are keyed by structural scope + call site + occurrence (87f2ea6), plus
  the texture they show. XF colours written inside display lists (0x100A-0x100D, light colours) are
  noted like the lists' BP colour writes, and untagged 2D colour registers are keyed by structural
  scope + call site + register + occurrence and blend with a draw of the same kind (8d11727).
  Still open: the scene fade-in on arriving in the foyer / returning from the save screen steps at 30
  Hz (sweep C: ~90% of the ramp at the tape change). It is none of these colour paths, nor a light's
  attenuation (tested: no light changes its attenuation then); candidates left are an EFB copy drawn
  back over the scene or vertex colours of 3D CPU-built blocks. Exceptions, shown as the newest
  game frame: a channel that jumps by more than 96 of 255 in one game frame (blinks, on/off,
  the hit flash), a register of another type (colour vs konst). Texture swaps (another texture
  object) switch. A GX light's colour (XF 0x600 + 16 n + 3, from GXLoadLightObjImm) takes the
  identity of the Light value of the same call (light object + slot, tagged even outside object
  scopes) and blends while that light pairs: Bogmire's arena lightning fades the scene light from
  white to black over ~1 s, loaded untagged per view, and stepped at 30 Hz (sweep C: 75-91% of each
  fade's change at the tape change, 33-34% after, the linear value). (Until b28a8fd colours were never blended: the water's bubbles and the shadow
  ghosts' shimmer stepped at 30 Hz.) Enhanced lighting's extra lights
  (the port's own lights) blend position, radius, colour and intensity by id; flags and shadow
  weight are b's (ghost glows, dramatic flares and flicker change every game frame: at b's values big
  lit areas stepped at 30 Hz).
- A pair that cannot be blended (rotation over ~150 degrees in one game frame, scale 16x, a jump over
  half its distance from the camera) is shown at b's world place under the in-between camera (Luigi's
  instant turns). The test is made in WORLD space (camera motion taken out; in view space a fast
  camera alone made nearby things "jump"). A turn over ~150 degrees is first tried against b turned
  180 degrees about each of its own axes: within 45 degrees of a, that equivalent is blended (matrices
  built from direction vectors, e.g. the Poltergust hose's segments, flip their roll between frames).
- Fast twists: a pair that turns by more than 75 degrees in one game frame mostly about one of its own
  axes (that axis turning by less than 35 degrees, the part scaled alike across it) takes the twist
  from b at once and blends only the rest (`untwist`). The Poltergust hose's envelope matrices are
  rebuilt from the hose direction every frame and their roll changes by up to ~150 degrees between
  game frames: blending spun the ribs around the tube. (Off since the screw blend, "The hose nozzle"
  below: the twist was taken about the matrix origin, far from the hose, and threw its rings off
  their place; `LM_SCREW_BLEND=0` restores it.)
- Model instances are handled as one (	agGroup: an S3D model, fn_80059C54 / fn_80059F6C /
  fn_8005A280's instance; a J3D model, its shape packets' matrix buffer at packet +0x14). Skinned
  parts are drawn with weighted sums of the model's joints (sheared, nearly flat where two joints
  differ a lot), so the skin only stays together if every matrix of the instance is blended alike:
  when one matrix jumps (its place moved farther than blending allows) the whole model is shown as b
  for that interval (counted as switches); when one turns by more than 90 degrees, cannot be blended
  by rotation or is squashed flat, every matrix of the model is blended entrywise in world space, so
  each skinned vertex moves in a straight line from its place in a to its place in b. The Poltergust
  hose is part of an S3D model (matrix pool around 0x814FF43C, near Luigi's nozzle): on the vacuum's
  on/off its matrices turn by 150-178 degrees in one game frame. Blended one by one (some switched,
  flip and twist resolution chosen per matrix) neighbours took different paths and the hose's skin
  stretched into long straight sticks (user clip with LM_FRAME_TAG: tape 160 alpha 0.05 and 0.34,
  tape 165 alpha 0.67); switching the whole model detached it from Luigi's hand (2f69188).
  An erratic member has no say in the instance's policy and is blended or switched on its own: one
  that moves by over 150 units, a quarter of its camera distance and three times its instance's
  median step (+60) in a game frame, or did so in the last 16 game frames (`Tape::worldErratic`), or
  sits more than 4x the instance's spread (and 250 units) from the median place of its members. The
  nursery's floating teddy bears (one J3D model, 49 matrices) carry draw matrices that land 800-1000
  units elsewhere every few game frames (unused or zero-weighted), with runs of small steps in
  between, and switched all the bears to 30 Hz (sweep B: 1.1-1.9k switches per 5 s near them, 0
  after). A whole instance moving fast (Chauncey's swoops) moves alike and keeps its say.
  (Correction, sweep B: that 49-matrix J3D instance is Luigi, seen near the bears; it follows him
  everywhere.) An instance of 4 or more voting members is switched for a jump only when at least half
  of them jumped (30f232a): a real respawn or teleport moves most members alike, while one stray
  member's first erratic step after a quiet spell switched all of Luigi. `LM_INTERP_TRACE=1` logs
  the votes ("jump vote ... median", "switched (n of m members jumped)"). Earlier
  attempts tagged fn_80091A70 (a cloth sheet) and J3D models only, which never reached the hose.
- Present hold (pacing::beforeEnd): on an even grid (VRR or VSync off) a frame built faster than
  usual is held until the usual time after its scheduled start (90th percentile of the last 60
  frames, at most 85% of the period), so every frame reaches the screen a constant time after the
  time its picture is for. Bogmire's fight at 4K with Enhanced lighting Ultra built frames in
  3-10 ms: presents came 5-13 ms apart while the motion advanced 8.6 ms each (display error p95
  3-5 ms, 1.2 ms elsewhere): an animated sky with a still camera juddered. `LM_PRESENT_HOLD=0`: off.
- Fast motion is not a jump: a pair that moves at most 2x + 60 units of what the same identity moved
  over the game frame before (`Tape::worldStep`, recorded by the replays) blends however far it goes
  (Chauncey's swoops, ~500 units per game frame, were snapped at 30 Hz).
- Spinners and tumblers (`noteTurn`): every model / normal matrix's world turn since its partner
  (angle and axis) is recorded per identity. One that turned by over 60 degrees in the game frame
  before (a spinner), or tumbles (two turns in a row over 20 degrees about axes more than 45 degrees
  apart; the evidence holds for 8 game frames), blends a turn over ~150 degrees the short way instead
  of switching. The element streams' drops take a random orientation every game frame (35-180
  degrees about any axis): those over 150 were shown at the game frame while the rest blended, and
  the water spray shimmered at 30 Hz (user report). Water spray, Luigi standing: 10-18k such
  switches per 5 s before, 1.4-2.9k after (drops in their first game frames, no history yet).
  Luigi turns about one axis (20-25 degrees per game frame), so his instant turns stay switches.
  A turn over 150 degrees also counts as evidence for the 8 game frames after it (drops whose random
  turns alternate small and large): 0.1-0.45k switches per 5 s left. A spinner / tumbler's blended
  matrix is then translated so the centre of its draw's position bounding box (sampled from the
  indexed positions when the display list is parsed, `Tape::bundleCentre`) moves in a straight line:
  turned 150-180 degrees about an origin outside the mesh, the spray's chunks swung along an arc and
  sat above both game-frame places mid-interval (sweep C, blips.py). The detector's ideal does the same.
  Only for rigid things: never for a member of a model instance with two or more matrices (its draw's
  centre is the whole mesh's; "Water and the hose" below). The element streams' drops are tumblers
  from their first game frame (`interp::tagTumbler`).
- Squashed-flat matrices (columns nearly coplanar: |det| < 0.1 x the product of the column lengths;
  Chauncey's squash-and-stretch bones) have no meaningful rotation or mirroring (their Gram-Schmidt
  frame flips between frames): only the axis lengths (16x) and the place are checked, and they blend
  entrywise in world space (`flatMatrix`). Rolling balls and Chauncey's spin (150-175 degrees per game
  frame) were switches (the turn direction is not knowable from two frames); with the spinner rule
  above they blend the short way once the previous game frame showed the spin.
  Sheared matrices (columns more than ~75 degrees from orthogonal) whose handedness flips between
  game frames are treated the same way (interp-final 3): Chauncey's envelope matrices pass through
  a singular blend of their joints at the start of every spin (determinant -4.9 -> +8.9 with 40-60
  degree "turns"), and the mirror test switched them, so his body held for one interval every
  150-400 game frames (sweep C; 534 member switches -> 3 in a map 10 run). The first frame of a real
  ~170 degree spin still shows b. `LM_SKEW_FLIP_SWITCH=1`: old behaviour. Such pairs get no flip or
  twist resolution (b turned 180 degrees is other geometry when sheared), their normal matrices blend
  entrywise too, and a sheared flip makes its model instance fast + skinned, so the whole instance
  blends entrywise. The S3D node and mesh draws (fn_800597C0 / 598E0 / 599E8, fn_80058A60,
  fn_800595B8) tag their model as the instance when none was inherited: Chauncey's meshes are drawn
  without the model draw and had no instance, so some of his envelope matrices blended rigidly and
  others entrywise at a spin and his skin tore into shards for half an interval (frame 6990,
  pre-existing). `LM_GROUP_TAPE=<seq>`: the instance votes of one tape.
- Projections: 2D (orthographic) ones are layout and never blended (the HUD anchors each element with
  its own projection; paired by order they slid HUD elements in the in-betweens); perspective ones
  blend only with one of the same aspect, except the shadow caster pass, which blends with its light.
- The shadow caster pass blends everything while its light blends (makeLightPair): its frustum is
  refitted every game frame ("shadows at any distance"); a caster shown as captured sits a frame
  apart from the receivers' lookup through the blended light (the shadows swam).
- Texture scrolls that wrap (offset back from 1 to 0, or faster than half the texture per frame) blend
  the short way modulo 1 (map 2's animated sky, water). The sky dome's texture matrices do so
  whatever their scale ("Boss arena skies" below).
- Texture scrolls of any scale, by history (`texWrapPairs`, at pairing; interp-final 3): a texture
  matrix (GX_TEXMTX ids) whose scale/rotation part is unchanged is compared row by row with the
  step it took the game frame before. The same step plus a whole number of textures is a wrap and
  blends by the step (so the old +-4 bound no longer matters); any other step over half a texture
  means the game placed the texture anew, and b is shown. Sweep of the boss arenas and every
  mansion entry point (`LM_TEXWRAP_LOG=<file>`, `LM_TEXWRAP_VALUES=1` adds the matrices): the only
  scale > 4 matrices that wrap are the skies' (now caught both ways); the only placed-anew ones are
  six J3D materials in the foyer (two sets per view) whose 3x3 part is ~0.005 (a colour looked up
  at one texture point) and whose offset jumps by 2-13 textures every ~64 game frames. Entrywise
  they swept the looked-up point through several textures within one game frame (colour flicker
  at the jump); they now change at the game frame. Matrices with entries within +-4 and no history
  keep the modulo-1 rule.
- SubView scopes (`fn_80114E18`: event scenes, E. Gadd's call portrait, the door close-ups) have their
  own camera: their values are not factored by the game camera; a model that moves by more than a
  tenth of its distance in one game frame switches. A skinned model there blends entrywise as a
  whole, other matrices rigidly about their draw's centre (their origin can be thousands of units
  away: "Event scenes: models far from their origin").
- Appear / disappear: b's set of draws is drawn for the whole interval (a new thing appears, a gone
  thing disappears, at the game frame); nothing is faded or redrawn from a.
- Camera cuts: b's main camera (the view most main-pass model matrices use) has no counterpart in a,
  or jumps more than 250 units / turns more than 30 degrees AND more than three times its previous
  frame's move/turn (a discontinuity; Bogmire's fast camera does that much every frame and is not a
  cut): b is shown as captured. Also a cut (ab2c506, bf38f99): b's main camera paired with a view of
  a that was not a's main camera and is far from it; a move over 1500 units; the number of views
  changing while the main view moves to another index (the order-based view keys then pair other
  cameras wrongly: chimney drop into the Sealed Room, the new-game foyer transition). Views drawn
  through exactly b's main camera follow its pair.
- The 60 Hz scenes, pauses and lockstep transitions keep the pacing of main.

A **call-site tag** (`interp::addSiteTag`) covers a draw loop inside one game function: while a GX
call comes from inside that function's code range, the item in the named register is a scope of its
own (a new item when the register changes). Birth stamps (`SiteTag::ageOffset/ageStep`): a u16 in the
particle that counts its age (+1 per game frame) or its remaining life (-1) makes its birth frame part
of the identity (found with `LM_TAG_PEEK=<words>`: 98-100% of particles step by exactly one).

### Tools

- `LM_TWIST_LOG=<file>`: model matrices turning by over 30 degrees in one game frame and how far each
  local axis turned. `LM_MTX_DUMP=<lo>,<hi>`: world matrices a, b and the blend for sources in that
  range. `LM_ARRAY_LOG=<file>`: every tagged position array per tape, its partner and how far it
  moved.
- `LM_TAG_LOG=<file>,<first>[,<last>]`: every value noted in those game frames with its key,
  category, call site, scope depth and view, and for untagged values the guest call chain; per tape
  the paired / unpaired / untagged counts by kind and the views with their keys. Finding the next
  tag source: run, take the most frequent untagged chains, look the function up
  (`tools/recomp/addr2sym.py`, the recompiled code in build/**/recomp_gen), hook it. `array` lines: every position array bound, with its scope's key (0: untagged, never blended)
  and call chain.
- **Judder detector** (`LM_JUDDER_LOG=<file>`, `LM_JUDDER_PX=<px>` default 1.5; live and in
  `LM_INTERP_TEST` runs). Aurora patch 0218 (`AuroraSetDrawProbe`) reports every draw with the
  matrix (and its PNMTX slot), projection and first vertex it is drawn with. Every in-between replay
  is tagged draw by draw; each draw of the main pass is judged against its ideal: for a tagged pair,
  the world transforms of that slot's matrix in a and b blended rigidly and seen through the ideal
  camera (rotation slerped, eye linear); for untagged / unpaired / world draws, b's world position
  under that camera. `J` lines: present, tape, alpha, cause (blend, snapped, camera, ...), error in
  px of a 2160-line picture, category, key, call site; `R` lines per replay; a `[judder]` summary in
  the game log every 5 s. **Identity check** (same log, `P` lines): a tagged model matrix followed
  over three game frames by its identity must not jump there and back in the middle frame (jerk > 30
  units and > 1.5x both steps): a wrong tag.
- `tools/interp/tint.py <run> [steps]`: every in-between whose mean colour (whole picture,
  or one of 16 tiles) lies outside its two game frames' range.
- `tools/interp/tagstats.py <tag log>`: values by kind/category and the most frequent untagged chains.
- `LM_INTERP_NOBLEND=<mask>` gained bit 7: enhanced lighting's extra lights shown as captured.
- `LM_PRESENT_DUMP=1` (with `LM_FRAME_DUMP=<dir>,<first>,<last>`): in a real-time run, every present
  of the tapes in the dump range is written as `f<frame>_p<present>_a<alpha x 1000>.ppm` (640x480
  EFB through the copy-to-RAM path, so the extra lights, shadows and bloom composited into the EFB
  are in it; not the post-process chain). It shows what each present looks like without
  `LM_INTERP_TEST`, which pauses the guest and changes the timing. Works at 60 fps. At 120 fps the
  dump's own cost made most tapes lose their dump marker (one file per run), so use 60 there.
- `LM_XL_LOG=<file>`: per replay (`P seq alpha f<dump frame> a <a seq> lights n`), every extra light
  with its id, identity key, paired or new, intensity in a and b and the intensity shown, and flags
  (shadow weight in bits 8-15).

### Foyer entry flicker report (October 2026, fixed: see "Cause" at the end)

User report (live, 60 fps presented on a 120 Hz G-SYNC TV, 4K, Enhanced lighting Ultra): "all the
lights flicker" in the new-game foyer intro. In the capture the shot after the cut at guest frame
2583 (left wall sconce, about 19.5-20.5 s into the clip) has the sconce's light pulse. Bright
presents show a wide, sharp-edged halo with no shadows. Dim presents show the sconce's own shadows
(bracket, table). They alternate about every 3 game frames, and values are often held for 3
presents. That session ran while other agents' builds kept the CPU at 100% (guest 21-26 fps at
times).

Not reproduced, in any of the following runs. The light stayed steady and its shadow faded in
smoothly in every run:
- Original 30, vanilla and Enhanced lighting;
- 60 and 120 fps with the user's own settings.ini (VSync on), render scale 2, 4 and 8, with
  `LM_JUDDER_LOG`;
- the shipped LuigisMansionRecomp package with a fresh setup;
- CPU starved to 2 or 1 cores (affinity), also with a cold pipeline cache;
- a second new game after a reset in the same session.

Every present was checked with `LM_PRESENT_DUMP`. The data paths were checked as well:
- extra-light intensities per present (`LM_XL_LOG`): smooth, every light paired;
- shadow slots and weights (`LM_LIGHT_SELECT_LOG=2`): the two candle groups gain their slots at the
  cut and fade in 64 -> 255 over 12 game frames, then stay;
- no lamp is lit (room-lit test) during the intro.

Seen in passing: under starvation, presents hold the same tape (alpha 0 or 1 repeated), which
matches the user's 3-present holds. Candidates left: what differs between the user's 4K fullscreen
swap chain and an off-screen window; state from the save played earlier in that session (not
reproduced with a reset and a second new game).
Follow-up (Aurora 0221, docs/RENDERING.md "Skipped draws are logged"): light shadow casters whose
pipeline was still compiling were skipped, which drops that light's shadow for the present. They
now wait like other draws, and every skipped draw is logged (per-second count plus the config of
each pipeline the first time). The user's next session log will show whether skips occurred.

**Cause (found later):** the runs above all used a 4:3 off-screen window. The user's window is 16:9,
and the flicker only shows at 16:9. Why the 4:3 runs stay clean was not checked; the effect may be
culled at 4:3. At 16:9 the effect at fn_801191B4 (Effect scope, GXSetProjection at 0x80119208) sets
the camera's projection again in this shot. Its scope's identity alternates between two keys, so it
pairs with the previous game frame only every third frame. Unpaired, it stayed b's projection while
the camera's other projections were blended: the intro camera zooms (p00 0.920 -> 0.916 -> 0.911 per
game frame). The draws after it, and with them enhanced lighting's shadow mask, had a projection
that disagreed with the rest of the in-between frame. The mask rebuilds view positions from the
depth pre-pass with the last world draw's projection. The left sconce's light sits 20 units in front
of the wall, and on those in-betweens the wall and the table came out fully shadowed, leaving only
the flames' glow. It faded back in with alpha. That happened in 2 of 3 game frames, every few
presents. Reproduced with `--window 1920x1080` and the user's settings.ini at 60 and 120 fps. The
light list was steady (`LM_XL_LOG`, now also with world positions), and the dark presents went away
with `LM_XL_SHADOWS=1,0` and with `LM_INTERP_NOBLEND=0x08` (projections as captured).

Fix (`replayPair`): an unpaired projection whose captured values (6 values + type) equal those of a
projection blended in the same replay gets that projection's blended values (`[interp] unpaired
projections per present given an identical projection's blend`: 0.67 in this shot). Verified with
`LM_PRESENT_DUMP` (frames 2585-2620, region luma per present): 60 fps, 68 presents, no drop (before:
drops of 6-9 every 2-3 presents); 120 fps, 144 presents, no drop. Original 30 is untouched (no
tapes there): vanilla 81 frames byte-identical, and Enhanced-lighting Ultra 80 frames byte-identical
apart from a run-to-run shift of one dump number (`LM_INPUT_CLOCK=frames`, keys
`1200:START*10,1600:A*6`, the shot at frames 3200-3240).
Testing note: test widescreen-sensitive rendering with a 16:9 window (`--window 1920x1080`). The
off-screen default window is 1280x960, so the game runs at 4:3 there.

### Room cloths: the shower curtain (October 2026)

User report (play build, 95-120 fps, 16:9): "this curtain did not get interpolated", the shower
curtain in the 2F bathroom, which sways at 30 Hz while everything else is smooth. Two causes:

1. **Untagged.** The room loop (`fn_800118FC` -> `fn_80028974`) walks a table of 0x388-byte cloth
   items (11 slots in map 2) and draws the active ones with `fn_80027F08(item)`: an indexed F32
   position array (149 vertices, rewritten by the game's cloth simulation every game frame) under
   the item's own matrix. It was bound outside any tag scope, so its array had no identity and
   stayed at the game frame's shape (`LM_TAG_LOG` now lists every bound array as an `array` line
   with its key and call chain; that is how it was found). `fn_80027F08` now opens an Object scope
   for the item (tags.cpp), and so does the other untagged array draw of the room loop,
   `fn_80025E00` (`fn_80025FC8`'s 0x24C-byte items). The curtain moves by a median of 6 and up to 37
   units per game frame (vacuumed); the array blend refuses only jumps over 200.
2. **Position format read at the wrong time.** An array's position format (component type,
   fraction) was looked up when the tape ended, from the vertex format slot of the first draw that
   read it. The slot is set up again for other layouts later in the frame (`fn_80027F08` uses
   `GXSetVtxAttrFmtv` on format 0), so the curtain's F32 positions were read as S16 and every
   blend was refused as a jump of ~59,000 units. The format is now taken when the draw reads the
   array (interp_vtx.cpp, `Cmd::posType`). This also applies to every other tagged CPU-deformed
   array (a 1751-vertex array in the bathroom moving ~0.15 units per frame now blends too).

Other cloths: in every other room checked (foyer, nursery, ballroom, dining room, parlor area,
study, Sealed Room, clockwork room, balcony, 3F hallway, graveyard, roof, secret altar) no cloth item
is active and no other untagged position array is bound apart from the particle quads' templates;
the ballroom's drapes, the dining room's tablecloth and the like are furniture models, blended by
their matrices. Slots 0-9 of the cloth table are empty in the retail mansion; any that becomes
active is covered by the same hook. The cloth's normals are direct vertex data and stay the game
frame's (lighting changes with its shape at 30 Hz, not visible in testing).

Verified with `LM_PRESENT_DUMP` at 120 (16:9, the user's settings, vacuuming the curtain): the
curtain changes on every present (mean luma change in its region 1.1-2.9 per present within a game
frame; before: 0.1-0.4 within a game frame, only noise, and 4-5 at each game frame). `[interp] 2.0
CPU-deformed position arrays blended per present` (the curtain, drawn in two views).
Original 30 byte-identical: vanilla, bathroom with the curtain moving, 61 frames; the user's
settings, foyer intro (`1200:START*10,1600:A*6`, frames 3200-3240, `AURORA_BEAM_FREEZE_TIME=1`), 41
frames.

### Enhanced lighting

- Extra lights (world candles/fires/lamps/sprays/lightning, ghost lights, test lights) pair by the
  providing code's id plus the generation of the object behind it (ghost actor, particle emitter); a
  pair whose world position jumps by more than 200 units is another light (b's place). Only position
  and radius blend: colour, intensity, flags and the shadow weight are always b's, so the yellow-tint
  class (a light's colour carried to another light's place) cannot happen.
- Ghost lights appear and vanish at the game frame (no partner: b's world place under the in-between
  camera; gone: not drawn).
- The light shadow maps, the flashlight's shadow map, AO, bloom/glow and the volumetric beam are
  computed by Aurora from each replayed (blended) scene, so they follow the blended casters, lights
  and camera. GX light directions are slerped (the flashlight's light stays on its cone's axis, which
  is blended by rotation); the realistic flashlight's anchors are world points blended by id.
- Not interpolation: the realistic flashlight's flare (Aurora `enhanced.cpp`, `g_flare`) follows
  wall-clock time between presents; in `LM_INTERP_TEST` runs (replays out of order) it makes
  in-betweens brighter than both game frames (identical numbers on main). Use
  `AURORA_BEAM_FREEZE_TIME=1` for comparable dumps.

### Text boxes: 2D layout blending and the phase lock (October 2026)

User report (live session, 120 Hz VRR TV): "some judder on text boxes as the text draws in"
(Neville's dialogue, the purple message window). The user's capture (120 fps; the session itself
presented 60 fps, `[interp] presented 60.0 fps` in its log) showed the window opening in steps that
lasted 4, 5, 2 and then 4 capture frames each (top edge 256 -> 196 -> 136 -> 100 px at 1080p), the
letters then every 4 frames except one 5 / 2 pair, the camera behind the translucent window smooth.
Two causes, both ours:

1. **The window's layout stepped at 30 Hz.** fn_80044138 draws the window as one 2D quad
   (`fn_8003B054`, texture 480x120, direct s16 positions, direct colours) that grows from a thin
   bar to its full height over 3-4 game frames (E. Gadd's call window: top 443 -> 413 -> 383 -> 353
   in the 640x480 layout). 2D blocks only blended their colours, so its edges jumped 30 units
   (60 px at 1080p) once per game frame while everything else moved every present.
   `blend2DLayout`: a 2D block paired by identity whose positions changed blends them too when it
   is the same picture (identity now includes the texture loaded into map 0; every vertex's
   texture coordinates identical in both frames), at least 48 layout units across in both frames
   (glyphs are smaller: letters still appear and lines still scroll at the game frame, as on the
   console), every vertex moving by at most 96 units, and it either changes size (opening,
   closing, pulsing) or moved the same way in the game frame before (sliding; a single jump such
   as a menu cursor stays a jump). Positions keep their format (s16: whole layout units, 4.5 px
   steps at 2160 lines). Also blended now: the health heart's pulse, the Game Boy Horror sliding
   up/down, the title menu boxes (the message windows and the call screen no longer: "Text boxes at
   the game frame" below). `LM_2D_LOG=<file>` logs every blended
   picture (tape, alpha, key, bounds a / b / shown); `LM_INTERP_2D_LAYOUT=0` turns it off; the
   `[interp] 2D pictures that moved` line counts blended / kept per present.
   Call window opening at 120 (4 presents per game frame), top edge shown per present:
   442 434 427 419 | 412 404 396 389 | 381 374 366 359 (before: 443 x4, 413 x4, 383 x4, 353).
2. **Presents at the tape boundaries** (`pace()`, phase lock). Whatever is shown as the newest
   game frame (2D layout, text, unpaired things, 30 Hz texture animations) changes at the first
   present past a tape's time. The delay put the presents anywhere in the game frame; when they sat
   next to the tape times (the drift between 29.97 Hz and the display, or a change of the measured
   delay, moves them there every few seconds), the ~1-2 ms jitter of the smoothed tape times decided
   whether a change came a present early or late: 1 / 3 presents per game frame at 60 fps instead
   of 2 / 2 (the user's 5 / 2 capture frames), 3 / 5 at 120, sometimes in bursts (1 3 2 1). The
   delay used (`lockD`) now keeps the target halfway between tape times: measured on the target,
   corrected by 10% of the phase error per present, kept between d - 0.25 and d + 1 present periods
   and moved by a whole period only when d leaves that range (so small changes of d no longer
   move the target either). Only when the presents per game frame are an integer (+-0.08).
   `LM_PHASE_LOCK=0`: off; the `[interp]` line shows `phase lock +x ms (n wraps)`.
   Measured with `LM_PACING_LOG` (call scenario, steady 30 Hz stretches, same build, hidden window
   on a busy machine): 60 fps, off: 0.87% of game frames shown for 1 or 3 presents (10 events in
   1151 frames, one a burst), first-present alpha spread over the whole game frame; on: 0.24%
   (4 in 1683, each a single wrap), 91% of first presents at alpha 0.20-0.25; stalls 11 -> 5,
   shown 25.9 -> 29.3 ms behind the newest game frame. 120 fps: alpha at the first present
   clustered at 0.10-0.125 (87%) instead of uniform.
3. Not changed: letters appear at the game frame (inherent; the game reveals one or two per game
   frame). Original 30 is byte-identical (21 frames 2600-2660 across the call window opening).

#### Text boxes at the game frame (follow-up, superseded by "Text boxes at 120" below)

User feedback on the above: "the text on textboxes is still jumpy perhaps we just leave all text
boxes at 30fps". The box opened smoothly while its letters still appeared at the game rate, so the
text jumped against the moving box. Now every text box is shown exactly as in its game frame, at
30 Hz, as on the console: the box, its text, the speaker icon, the "more" arrow and choices, and the
portrait that goes with it. Nothing inside a text box blends (position or colour).

- `interp::pushFrameLock` / `FrameLockScope` (interp.h): nothing noted inside, so it replays as
  captured: matrices, lights, colour registers (`note`, `noteColors`, display-list colours), 2D and
  3D vertex blocks with their colours, CPU position arrays (`arrayKey`). A direct-vertex draw is noted
  at the next GX call, which can come after the scope has closed, so the lock is taken at its
  `GXBegin` (`vertsBegin`). Without that, the window's last quad still blended.
- Where text boxes are drawn (found with `LM_INTERP_DRAWS` call chains and `LM_2D_LOG`):
  - `fn_80044138` (tags.cpp; from the frame loop `fn_8000BCE8`) draws every message window through
    `fn_800433B4`: the box picture (`fn_8003B054`), the speaker icon, the text, choices (the lab's
    green "The Mansion / The Training Room / The Gallery" box). All dialogue goes through it:
    Neville, Toad, E. Gadd in the lab and on the call, signs, the file-select messages.
  - Room / area name (`fn_80045BDC`, widescreen.cpp).
  - While a message window is on screen (it drew in this game frame or the one before;
    `tags::textBoxShown`, counted with `interp::drawCount`), the Game Boy Horror (`fn_8003D634`), its
    noise (`fn_8003BE9C`) and the event portrait (`fn_80114E18`): during E. Gadd's call the GBH is his
    call window. It shakes as the call comes in; its bezel used to blend while the picture inside
    stayed put. (The GBH screen mode `lbl_804D846C` stays 4 in the `call` scenario's call, so it
    cannot tell the call apart.)
- Still blended (not text boxes): the health heart's pulse, the HUD sliding out when a dialogue
  starts and back after, the Game Boy Horror sliding up/down outside dialogue, the title menu boxes,
  the area-result iris wipe.
- The phase lock in `pace()` stays: it keeps the game-frame changes evenly spaced. Call scenario,
  game frames 2560-2900 (`LM_PACING_LOG`, presents per game frame): 120 fps 339 x 4 and 2 single 5s
  (the lock moving by one present, `1 wraps`); 60 fps 340 x 2 and 1 single 3. No alternating 5/3 or
  3/1 runs. With the frame cost above the present period (another instance running, the lab's
  ~11 ms at 120) the rate falls below 120 and 3/4 alternate, as before.
- Checked per present with `LM_PRESENT_DUMP`: at 120 in the call (frames 2624-2700) the window's text
  area and the GBH change only at the first present of each game frame; at 60 in the lab dialogue
  (`LM_START_MAP=4`) the window opens in whole game-frame steps over the smoothly moving scene.
  `LM_2D_LOG` (which now also prints the draw's call site and `f<game frame>`) lists no
  message-window picture in either.
- Original 30 byte-identical (41 frames 2620-2660 of the call scenario, window opening included).

#### Text boxes at 120 (October 2026, replaces the game-frame lock above)

User: "if you can figure out how to get the textboxes correctly interpolated, then do so, but if not
keep them at 30" and "if you touch the textboxes then do the letters too". Every text box is now
replayed as **one 2D layout**: the box, its text, the speaker icon, the "more" arrow, the choices,
and (during E. Gadd's call) the Game Boy Horror with his portrait move and scale together on every
present, and each letter fades in over the game frame that adds it. There is no option; the old
lock is the test aid `LM_TEXTBOX_LOCK=1` (`=0`: neither, the plain value-by-value replay).

**First, a capture bug.** At 16:9 every 2D vertex block was noted at the wrong tape offset: the
widescreen code holds a 2D draw until it can classify it (`sHeld` in hle_gx.cpp) and then writes its
projection, `GXBegin` and vertices, but the block's offset was taken at the game's first FIFO write,
before all of that. `blend2DLayout` and the 2D colour blending read a projection's floats as
positions and colours (and the colour blend wrote into them). The offset is now taken where the
data is written (`interp::vtxDataAt` for held draws; `vtxBytes` runs after the write otherwise). The
"Text boxes: 2D layout blending" results above were measured at 4:3, where draws are not held.

**Groups** (`interp::pushTextGroup(id, oneLayout)` / `TextGroupScope`, interp.cpp
`replayTextGroups`). Everything noted inside a group is skipped by the value-by-value replay and
replayed by the group:
- `fn_80044138` (every message window), `fn_80045BDC` (room name; floor picture and name) and
  `fn_8003D634` (the Game Boy Horror, always, `oneLayout`); `fn_8003BE9C` (the GBH's static noise)
  joins the GBH's group (`pushTextGroupJoin`), and during E. Gadd's call the portrait's viewport and
  scissor box (`fn_80114E18`, `pushTextViewJoin`) do too. Viewports and scissor boxes written inside a
  group (`noteTextViewport` / `noteTextScissor` from hle_gx.cpp, with the widescreen x mapping
  `f x + c` of that moment) are moved with it.
- **Panels.** A group's 2D blocks are split by their box pictures: a textured quad at least 48 units
  across starts a panel, pieces drawn right before or after it by the same code with the same
  texture that touch it extend its box (the choice box is nine pieces, `fn_8003B390`, opening by
  moving and stretching them), and the blocks drawn after them (text, icon, arrow) belong to it. In a
  `oneLayout` group everything follows the first picture. Panels pair with the previous game frame's
  in order by what their box is drawn with.
- **The box's transform.** A panel whose box rectangle changed size blends it (opening, closing);
  one that only moved blends small moves (up to 32 units: the GBH rising 1-3 units per game frame as
  the call starts) and larger ones only when it moved the same way the game frame before (a slide;
  a single jump stays a jump). `M` maps b's rectangle onto the blended one and is applied to every
  block of the panel, through the position matrix or the orthographic projection they are drawn with
  when everything drawn with it moves alike (exact for any vertex format), else on each block's
  vertices. s16 pictures on that last route can only land on whole units: their panel then takes the
  rounded rectangle, so it moves by the same whole units; while a box opens or closes, a picture
  inside it can be up to half a unit (2 px at 2160 lines) from its exact place.
- **Text.** The blocks of a panel are matched to the previous game frame's by what they show
  (texture, texture coordinates, size) and where they sit in their box: (1) at the same place
  (letters already shown, the icon); (2) moved by `D`, the most common offset among the rest (the
  page scrolling up a line over several game frames, at least 3 blocks); (3) a unique picture of the
  same page that moved by up to 16 units on its own. J2DPrint draws a page's text from its start
  every game frame, so the text so far is the same sequence with new letters at its end.
- **Drawn.** Scrolling text (and the letters new in it) is drawn `D x (1 - alpha)` behind b's place,
  the whole text layer moving smoothly inside the scissor box; a block that moved on its own blends
  its positions; matched blocks blend their colours (unless a channel jumps); a letter new in b has
  its vertex alpha scaled by the present's alpha (0 at the game frame that adds it, its full value
  at the next). A page change or a box closing switches at the game frame: the old text is gone in b,
  so it never blends into the new text, which fades in.
- Matching and panels are built once per pair of tapes (`Tape::textCache`); replay cost is the same
  as before (toad scenario at 120: 1.5-1.9 ms host replay per present, main 1.5-1.8).

**Evidence** (the user's settings.ini with the frame rate overridden: 120 with VSync off, 60 with
VSync on; `--window 1920x1080`, off-screen; `LM_TEXTBOX_LOG=<file>` with `LM_TEXTBOX_LOG_BLOCKS=1`
writes, per replay and group, every box's rectangle in a, b and shown, and per block what it paired
with, how, its layout position and the alpha shown; `LM_PRESENT_DUMP` for the pictures). Measured
from the logs (`tools/interp/textbox_check.py <log> [group id]`), per present within each game frame:

| scenario (fps) | box edges move monotonically toward b | text glyph offset to its box (scroll layer removed), max change | letter alpha ramps | at the game frame change, offset to the box |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| call (120) | 335 of 335 box/game-frame series | 0.008 units (32,655 series) | 744 ramps, all monotonic; 743 of 743 at least as opaque in the next game frame | 0.002 units |
| call (60) | 335 of 335 | 0.000 | 669 ramps monotonic, 743 of 743 | 0.002 |
| Toad, two boxes and the choice box opening and closing (120) | 159 of 159 | 0.005 (11,406 series) | 272 monotonic, 271 of 271 | 0.15 (the s16 icon while the choice box opens) |
| Toad (60) | 159 of 159 | 0.000 | 253 monotonic, 271 of 271 | 0.51 (same icon) |
| lab: dialogue, choice box (120) | 1646 of 1646 | 0.009 (145,990 series) | 1399 monotonic, 1396 of 1396 | 0.13 |
| GBH group in the call (120) | 2328 of 2328 | 0.000 (46,082 series, its pieces and the call screen) | | 0.000 |

From the pictures (640x480 EFB per present): the call window's top edge at 60 moves
446.8 | 436.7, 424.1 | 410.8, 397.3 | 383.7, 370.1 | 369.0 (before: one step per game frame); the
scrolling text measured against the static box (vertical profile, sub-pixel least squares) moves
about 0.75 px per present at 120 through the whole scroll (3 units per game frame, 4 presents),
with no step at the game frames; the GBH rising as the call starts measured the same way
(-7.65, -6.80, -6.15, -5.40 | -4.80, -4.30, -3.80, -3.30 | -2.85 ...) moves on every present, the
portrait's viewport with it (`  V viewport` lines). Choice boxes in the Toad and lab dialogues open
and close smoothly with their text inside and fading in. Original 30 is byte-identical to main (101
frames 2600-2700 of the call scenario with the user's settings, window opening, text, GBH and
portrait included).

Not reached in testing: Neville's portrait dialogue (teleported to him he woke up and attacked);
Toad and E. Gadd's portrait call cover the speaker icon and portrait cases.

#### Text box fixes from the final sweeps (interp-final 3)

- Full-frame viewports and scissor boxes in a group are not moved with the panel: the GBH's status
  page resets them to 640x480 inside the GBH group, and moving them as a sub-view drew the page 2x
  the panel's offset off while the HUD slid in (a gap under the bezel, a jump back at each game
  frame). Only boxes smaller than the frame (the call portrait, the GBH screen's scissor) move.
- A text scroll (offset D) must match at least a quarter of a's text blocks not already in place:
  a new page whose first letters also occur on the old page's second line ("So" of "Sounds") was
  taken for a scroll and slid up from there. Real scrolls match 50-60 of 110-128 blocks.

### Extra lights: room box (interp-final 3)

An extra light's room box (flag `ExtraLightRoomBox`, Aurora 0187) stores its centre relative to the
light's position. Blending the position moved the box with the light by its whole step at alpha 0,
cutting off the part of the room the light was leaving: Luigi's fire stream lighting the 2F east
hallway wall went dark at each game frame and came back by alpha 1 (sweep B, region luma 25.7 at
every game-frame start against 28.9-38 at the game frames). The centre now stays at b's world
place; afterwards the series is monotonic at 60 and 120. `LM_XL_BOX_SLIDE=1`: old behaviour. The
receivers' shadow light (makeLightPair) also moves its eye in a straight line now, like the caster
pass's light camera (`LM_LIGHT_ARC=1`: old; measured identical in that scene).

### Boss arena skies (October 2026)

User reports: the boss arena skies (Chauncey map 10, Boolossus 11, Bogmire 13, the roof 9) were
"jumpy" with interpolation. First they were locked to their game frame (below, now the test aid
`LM_SKY_LOCK=1`). That made the sky step at 30 Hz against the smoothly moving arena whenever the
camera turned. The cause was then found and fixed, and the skies are blended again. There is no
menu option: the blended sky is the only behaviour.

- **Where the sky is drawn.** `fn_8002FA34` (tags.cpp; `us pal`), called by the room loop
  `fn_80011824` once per view before the rooms when the map has a sky. Its descriptor comes from
  `lbl_80300C7C[sCurMapNo]`: map 9 (roof, King Boo / Bowser) `0x80300C30` (vrKoopa, the fire
  sky), maps 10 (Chauncey), 11 (Boolossus' balcony) and 13 (Bogmire's cemetery) `0x80300B04`
  (vrball_B), map 2 `0x80300B60` (vrball_M). It advances the sky's three animation tables (texture
  SRT scroll and colour animations, the loops over `0x803CD588 + 0x50 / 0xA0 / 0xF0 / 0x140 / 0x190`),
  places the dome at the camera (`fn_800102B0`, J3DSys's view matrix), runs `viewCalc` and
  `drawInit`, loads its own lighting (`fn_800AAF5C`: constant J3D ambient/material colours and
  GX light 7, all from sdata2) and draws its two draw buffers (`fn_801C043C` / `fn_801C0050`; two
  display lists, 0x400 and 0xAA0 bytes, in `LM_DL_TRACE`). `LM_TAG_LOG` marks it (`mark sky begin`
  / `mark sky end`, `interp::tagLogMark`). Inside: drawInit's matrices, the dome's position/normal
  matrices per material packet (view-space translation 0: it sits at the eye, rotation = the
  camera's), three texture matrices per material (`0x801BF274`: the SRT scroll), the projection,
  light 7 and the TEV colour registers (`0x801BF574`, the colour animations). Everything set
  inside the call: nothing scene-wide (Bogmire's lightning lights 0-2, the room ambient) reaches
  the sky. The first call per frame (another view) draws nothing.
- **What was wrong.** Values of every replay of the sky logged with the test aid
  `LM_SKY_LOG=<file>,<first>,<last>` (a, b and the value shown, per present; tags.cpp marks the
  sky's values with `interp::pushSky`). Everything in the sky pairs (only four constant colour
  words of `fn_800AAF5C` are untagged). The dome follows the blended camera exactly: its view-space
  rotation shown equals the blended main camera's, translation 0. Colour animations blend. The
  texture scrolls did not. Each layer repeats its texture 2-10 times across the dome (matrix scale
  entries 6, 4, -8, -10 on vrball_B, 2-6 on vrKoopa). Each layer's offset wraps by a whole number
  (1 on vrball_B, also 3 and 5 on vrKoopa) about every 60 game frames. That is invisible on the
  console, because the texture repeats. `blendTexWrap` only took matrices with every entry within
  +-4 (texture-coordinate matrices, not projections), so these were blended entrywise: in the game
  frame of a wrap the layer swept back through a whole texture period and forward again. Chauncey's
  sky has three layers, so a jump came about every 20 game frames, idle or not. Measured at 120
  (sky pixels' mean change per present over the alpha advanced, 640x480 present dumps): 82 at a
  wrap against a median of 3.3 (25x). Not the cause: the dome's model matrix (pairs and follows the
  camera), its projection (pairs, constant), colour or light jumps, re-centring on another frame's
  camera.
- **Fix.** `blendTexWrap(..., sky)`: for the sky's texture matrices the +-4 bound is dropped, and
  only the scale/rotation part must barely change. Offsets that changed by more than half a
  texture blend the short way modulo 1 (`d - round(d)`), so a wrap by 1, 3 or 5 moves the layer by
  its usual per-frame step. Other texture matrices keep the old rule. Afterwards every sky value
  moves monotonically between its game frames (`LM_SKY_LOG`, maps 9, 10, 11, 13 and the Hidden
  Mansion Chauncey). `LM_SKY_LOCK=1`: the old full lock of the boss arena skies (maps 9, 10, 11,
  13; `interp::FrameLockScope`); `=2`: every map's sky. `LM_SKY_HIDE=1`: no sky at all (finding
  sky pixels).
- **Evidence** (120 target, VSync off, 1920x1080 offscreen, the user's settings.ini, `LM_PRESENT_DUMP`,
  Luigi walking left then right; `LM_START_MAP`, `LM_SKIP_CUTSCENES=1 LM_SKIP_AUTO=30`; sky pixels =
  pixels that differ between Original 30 runs with and without the sky and are black without it,
  in 90% of the frames). Sky motion per present = median shift of the all-sky 24x24 blocks;
  a game frame is flagged when its present steps are uneven by over 1 px or go against the
  frame's direction by over 0.5 px:

  | arena (frames) | blended before the fix | locked (`LM_SKY_LOCK=1`) | blended now |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Chauncey 10 (4300-4440) | 11 of 99 flagged; wrap jumps (rate up to 82, median 3.3) | 57 of 82 (whole step at one present) | 2 of 124 (a camera reversal at the game frame, a dump stall); rate max 29.8 only at a dark plane in front of the sky that Original 30 and the locked run show too |
  | Bowser 9 (4120-4240) | not measured (its layers wrap by 1, 3 and 5) | 116 of 117 (the fire sky scrolls 2-2.7 px per game frame) | 0 of 91, worst 0.47 px |
  | Boolossus 11 (4300-4420) | not measured (same sky as 10) | 78 of 121 (steps up to 5.6 px) | 1 of 121 (14 sky blocks behind his translucent body: noisy) |
  | Bogmire 13 (4120-4240) | not measured (same sky as 10) | | only a thin strip of sky at that camera (no full block); the only spike of the per-present change is a lightning flash (the whole arena, at the game frame) |

  Scripts in the agent's scratchpad (not committed).
- Original 30 byte-identical (141 frames 3150-3290 of Chauncey's arena, no cutscene skip; runs
  with `LM_SKIP_CUTSCENES` are not deterministic from run to run).

### Water and the hose (October 2026, after 1.0)

User's known issues after 1.0: "A few things appear erratic while interpolating higher framerates:
mostly water spray effects, sometimes the tube on the Poltergust 3000 jumps for a frame or two".
On the hose: "only rarely does it freak out for just a second". Every water effect goes through the
same element-stream code: `fn_8011FB40` draws each stream's points (`fn_80120C30`, one GX point
each) and its drops (`fn_800F3120`, one shared S3D model per item in two item loops). Water effects
checked: the Poltergust's water spray (nursery), the courtyard fountain (map 2 room 24,
`LM_SKIP_TEST=2650:pos:-450,0,-5650`), the kitchen faucet's drip and splashes (room 7,
`2650:pos:-3050,0,-1950`), and Spooky's garden in the Boneyard (room 11, `2650:pos:-3000,0,-2700`).

**What was wrong**
1. *Points re-placed or not, by the wrong test.* A point was "born anew" unless it was within half
   its last speed of last place + last velocity. `LM_POINT_LOG` shows three kinds of points:
   - 24-byte points move by their new velocity exactly: p = last p + v, to the float, in 92,095 of
     92,095 continuing points;
   - points whose +12 is stale or zero (0xF0-byte objects in the spray, the fountain's arcs, the
     garden's falling drops) move smoothly 10-35 units per game frame. The test took them for new
     points every game frame, so they had no partner and moved at 30 Hz;
   - a point that hits the ground in the garden or a fountain basin bounces: the game reflects its
     velocity (p = last p + v exactly). The interpolator's turn-back rule for CPU-built blocks then
     held it at the game frame's place for the interval of every bounce.
2. *Loop 1's drops have no stable slot.* The item list is rebuilt every game frame. Of the drops
   followed in the nursery, 12% kept their item. Paired by item, drops blended toward other drops
   100-700 units away, or were switched at the game frame ("jump" and "turn" in the detector).
3. *Drops' first game frames.* Drops take a random orientation every game frame. A turn over 150
   degrees switched until the drop had tumble evidence. A new drop or point stood at its place for
   its first interval, then moved on. Splashes growing 5-8x along one axis in a game frame failed
   the scale limit and switched.
4. *The hose.* `LM_GROUP_LOG` (per tape: each model instance's members, outliers, erratic members,
   votes, fast turns, sheared flips, unpaired members and the policy) found no instance-level
   trigger in 3 x 5 minutes of varied play. The trigger was in the per-matrix path. A member that
   turned by more than 60 degrees counted as a spinner for the next game frame. One that tumbled
   counted for 8 game frames. Either way, while the instance blended per matrix, the member got the
   spinner rule's straight-line centre correction. That centre is the draw's bounding-box centre,
   which for a member of a skinned model is the centre of the whole mesh, so each member was
   shifted by its own amount. In Luigi's model (the hose included) shifts reached 115 units, more
   than 30 units in 60 game frames of a 4-minute run, each for one interval: the hose and limbs
   tore "for a frame or two". The judder detector's ideal used the same rule, so it never flagged it.

**What it does now** (tags.cpp, interp.cpp)
- Points continue when drawn the game frame before and either
  - moved by their own velocity (0.05 units),
  - kept their last step (3 units + 25%: gravity and drag change it by ~1 per game frame), or
  - in their second game frame, moved by up to 30 units.

  Otherwise they get a new generation. They are tracked (`interp::tagTracked`): turning back is a
  bounce and blends.
- Loop-1 drops are followed by place (`DropTracker`: nearest drop of the game frame before, carried
  by its own last step; tolerance 8 units + 30% of the step). The track is the identity. Loop 2
  keeps its items, with a new generation when the life counter (+3) rises.
- All drops are tumblers from their first game frame (`interp::tagTumbler`): turns blend the short
  way, the drawn centre moves in a straight line, and scale changes have no limit. One whose random
  orientation is mirrored in only one of the two game frames blends entrywise, like a sheared flip.
  Before this fix the ceiling splashes switched.
- Born moving (`interp::tagBackStep`). A point without a partner is shown at b - (1 - alpha) v,
  where v is its velocity (for the exact-velocity kind). A drop without a partner uses the step of
  the nearest followed drop within 80 units, or else of the nearest exact point within 120 units. So
  new spray leaves the nozzle moving instead of standing still for an interval. The detector's ideal
  does the same.
- The spinner centre rule applies to rigid things only (`Tape::multiMember`: not to a position matrix
  of an instance with two or more). The detector judges members by their own rigid motion, also with
  the old rule (`LM_PIVOT_MEMBERS=1`), so that run shows what the rule did.
- Test aids: `LM_POINT_OLD=1` (old points test, no tracking or back step), `LM_STREAM_OLD=1` (items
  as identities, no tumblers or back steps), `LM_PIVOT_MEMBERS=1`. Logs: `LM_POINT_LOG`,
  `LM_STREAM_LOG`, `LM_SPRAY_LOG` (every point / drop per replay: key, how shown, world place)
  with `tools/interp/spray_check.py`, and `LM_GROUP_LOG` (+ `.x`: excluded members' treatment and
  pivot shifts) with `tools/interp/group_check.py`. `tools/interp/present_blips.py` compares
  `LM_PRESENT_DUMP` runs.

**Evidence.** Conditions: the user's settings.ini with the frame rate overridden (120 with VSync off,
60 with VSync on), `--window 1920x1080` off-screen, `LM_INPUT_CLOCK=frames`, about 4 minutes per run.
Old = `LM_POINT_OLD=1 LM_STREAM_OLD=1 LM_PIVOT_MEMBERS=1` on the same build. The machine was shared
with five other game instances, so 120 fps targets presented 75-85 fps.

`spray_check.py` follows every point and drop present by present and judges each interval and each
game-frame join:
- hold/n: a thing without a partner standing still for an interval;
- gap: the next interval starts away from where the last one ended (a snap or a wrong pair);
- nonlinear: off the straight line inside an interval.

The judder detector's visible counts come from the same runs; switches exclude the teleport's game
frame.

Old = the first build of this branch with the old rules (`ev` runs); new = the final build (`fin3`
runs, after the mirrored-tumbler and scale fixes), the same inputs.

| scene, fps | points hold/n old / new | points gap | drops hold/n | drops gap + nonlinear | detector visible blend defects | visible switches |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nursery spray 120 | 7372 (5.5%) / 352 (0.26%) | 4 / 0 | 2226 / 50 | 802 / 0 | 1794 / **0** | 191 / **0** |
| nursery spray 60 | 1234 / 314 | 0 / 0 | 316 / 47 | 92 / 0 | 650 / **0** | 341 / **0** |
| courtyard fountain 120 | 54757 (2.3%) / 1042 (0.05%) | 57 / 0 | 12477 / 104 | 502 / 0 | 4643 / **0** | 107 / **0** |
| courtyard fountain 60 | 47205 / 1014 | 44 / 0 | 9048 / 96 | 440 / 0 | 3337 / **0** | 64 / **0** |
| Spooky's garden 120 | 30041 (5.7%) / 677 (0.15%) | 136 / 0 | 12061 / 57 | 4834 / 0 | 1410 / **0** | 1172 / **0** |
| Spooky's garden 60 | 27086 / 611 | 109 / 0 | 10863 / 53 | 4130 / 0 | 947 / **0** | 807 / **0** |
| kitchen faucet 120 | 14183 (6.5%) / 185 (0.07%) | 111 / 0 | 5196 / 6 | 2404 / 0 | 2386 / **0** | 792 / 3 |
| kitchen faucet 60 | 16118 / 171 | 116 / 0 | 5748 / 3 | 2877 / 0 | 2160 / **0** | 536 / 3 |

The kitchen's 3 switches are a J3D model (src 81377710) whose matrices jump about 860 units in one
game frame: a respawn, at the game frame by design. The remaining new points without a partner
(0.07-0.26% of point intervals) are points born in slots not yet seen moving by their own velocity,
so they have no step to be born along.

Also flagged as "hold", in old and new alike, are drops resting with an unchanged matrix in both
game frames (the game's own; 7-18% of drop intervals) and drops born next to resting drops (moving
along a zero step).

Hose, the varied-play A/B: foyer, water element, fast vacuum swings, R taps, turning on the spot,
walking, reversals, spraying, a hit every 450 game frames; 10 minutes, same input. Old: 223,494
blend defects (Luigi's model members, `loadPosMtxIndx` draws), more than 30 px off in 814 game
frames (2160-line picture). New: 0, and 0 at 60 fps (VSync on) with the same input. `LM_GROUP_LOG`
V lines (members moved by the centre rule) went from 5693 tapes for Luigi's instance to none.

Original 30 is byte-identical to main with the user's settings at a 30 target
(`LM_INPUT_CLOCK=frames`, `AURORA_BEAM_FREEZE_TIME=1`, frames 2690-2760):
- before the final merge, against db02360: 71 frames of the nursery water spray and 71 frames of the
  courtyard fountain;
- final build, against c6813d6: 71 frames of the nursery water spray and 71 frames of Spooky's garden.

The new code runs only while tapes are captured.

Remaining: the 98-matrix J3D instance at about (0, 600, 50) in the foyer (src 8136BEC0-8136C1F0) has erratic
members that switch (590 "jump" lines in 10 minutes, the same with the old rule). It is not part of
the hose or the water; it was left alone.

### The hose nozzle (October 2026, branch hose-jump)

Owner's report after 1.1.3: "The Poltergust hose nozzle STILL jumps from time to time ... it's the
only interpolation issue left", to be tested under heavy movement. The judder detector could not
see it: its ideal used the same blending rules as the replay (a rule that moves a part the wrong
way is also its ideal), and switches by policy are counted as correct.

**Detector: the path check** (`LM_TRACK_LOG=<file>[,<radius>[,<px>]]`, with `LM_JUDDER_LOG` for
the draw probe and `LM_JUDDER_EVERY=1`; `trackJudge` in interp.cpp). Independent of every policy:
each drawn vertex (the first vertex of every primitive the FIFO draws in an in-between, Aurora 0218's
probe) within `radius` (300) of Luigi is taken back to world space through the ideal in-between
camera and compared with the straight line between its two game-frame places (the matrices its
PNMTX slot held at capture in a and b). A rigid turn moves a vertex along an arc, so the allowance
is 1 unit + (0.45 x min(1, 4 alpha (1 - alpha)) + 0.03) x its game-frame step: small near the game
frames, up to the arc of a ~150 degree turn mid-interval. Off by more than that and `px` (3, of a
2160-line picture) is a jump: shown at b early, held at a, or swinging off the path. H lines per
vertex (error, step, how far along the step it is shown, the member's turn and origin step, its
model instance, matrix source, whether it is within 60 units of the nozzle), HR per replay, HC for
presents shown without blending (camera cuts, gaps), HT per game frame (Luigi's, the Poltergust
nozzle actor's (+0x7A4) and +0x7A8's places), HG/HV (every 60 / 600 tapes) a census of the model
instances near Luigi and all their vertices (what each instance is, by its shape). A `[track]`
summary goes to the game log every 5 s. `tools/interp/hose_check.py <log>` summarizes a run: jump
events (game frames with a jump) near the nozzle and near Luigi, classes, policies, instances, the
worst events, whole-picture presents and game-side jumps of the nozzle actor.

**Heavy-movement suite** (`tools/interp/hose_suite.py <out> [--scenario ...] [--fps ...] [--secs S]
[--user-settings] [--radius R] [--env K=V]`): one game at a time, off screen, muted, below-normal
priority, scratch APPDATA / card, LM_INPUT_CLOCK=frames, the input script from a file
(`--input @file`, new: long scripts exceed the command line). The mix repeats from game frame 2600:
running in circles both ways (4 frames per eighth of a turn), sharp left/right and up/down
reversals, strafing with the vacuum on, vacuum taps while circling, C-stick sweeps with and without
R, running with R and the C stick against the run, the flashlight off and on, an idle spell (idle
and scared animations) and a fast start. Scenarios: `run` (nursery), `foyer` (plus long runs up
the stairs and through the doors), `fire` / `water` / `ice` (L bursts and taps), `hit`
(LM_TEST_HIT every 150 game frames), `ghosts` (gold ghosts room, LM_GHOST_HUNT stuns and vacuums
them: Luigi dragged around), `boss` (Boolossus, one check).

**What it found.** Model instances near Luigi (census): his S3D model with the Poltergust (93
matrices), the hose (a J3D model of ~32 joint matrices, 10 at a time, loaded with
`J3DSys::loadPosMtxIndx`), the nozzle's small S3D models (4 and 9 matrices) and the suction swirl (a
J3D model of 49 matrices drawn while R is held). In the `run` scenario at 120 (2 minutes): 525 game
frames with jumps near Luigi, 308 of them at the nozzle (old rules). Classes:
1. *Blending about the matrix origin.* A joint matrix of a skinned or articulated model carries
   the model's origin (its vertices are stored in model space), often 50-1200 units from the
   vertices it moves. The rigid blend (rotation slerped, translation linear) turned the part about
   that origin: a hose segment or the nozzle turning 30-90 degrees in a game frame swung its
   origin by 50-200 units, and the straight origin path pulled the vertices off their own path by
   0.5-1.5 times their step for the interval (the hose and nozzle "jumping" mid-interval, in a
   different direction for each joint). All three of Luigi's instances, 90% of the events.
2. *Untwist about the origin.* The fast-twist rule (above: "Fast twists") turned a's matrix about
   its local axis through the ORIGIN by the twist, at once. For the hose's joint matrices that axis
   is 20-160 units from the hose: the nozzle ring and hose rings were thrown 15-145 units off
   their place for a whole interval at every fast roll (77-87 degrees), while the game frames moved
   them 4-20 units.
3. *Place jumps measured at the origin.* "A jump over half its distance from the camera" and the
   erratic-member test measured the origin's step: the suction swirl's joints (spinning 60-150
   degrees per game frame about the nozzle) moved their origins 300-1200 units while the swirl
   moved 50-350, and members were switched one by one (the swirl torn for an interval, at the
   nozzle).
4. *Members switched on their own.* A member of an instance that is not switched as a whole but
   cannot be blended rigidly (a mirror flip of a rigid joint, a half turn) was shown as b while
   its neighbours blended.

**What it does now** (all switchable back with `LM_SCREW_BLEND=0`, for A/B):
- *Screw blend* (`screwTranslation`, used by `blendRigid` for 3x4 matrices): the motion from a to
  b is a rotation by theta about an axis through some point plus a slide along it; the in-between
  turns by t x theta about that same axis and slides t of the way. Every point moves along an arc
  about the part's real pivot, whatever origin the matrix has; the 3x3 part is the same slerp as
  before, and alpha 0 / 1 give a / b exactly. Nearly no turn (< 0.6 degrees) or a half turn (> 177
  degrees) keep the linear origin.
- No untwist (the twist is a turn about the part's own axis, which the screw blend follows).
- Place steps, the camera distance and the erratic test use where the geometry is: the centre of
  the vertices of the draw that use the matrix's slot (`SlotCentres`: per draw, the bounding box
  of the indexed positions per direct PNMTXIDX slot, interp_vtx.cpp), else the draw's centre, else
  the origin (`placeStep`, `drawCentre`, `viewDist`).
- The outlier test (a member far from its instance's median place) uses the same geometry
  centres: by origins, the swirl's members were outliers (no say) whenever it spun.
- A steady member (not erratic, its instance not switched) is not switched for its place alone.
  A member that cannot be blended rigidly (a mirror flip, a turn over ~150 degrees without spin
  evidence, a half turn over ~170 degrees also when erratic, a place jump its instance did not
  vote for, or an envelope matrix whose axes change length by more than 30% in a game frame: its
  joints' weights moved, e.g. a hose envelope from 0.94 to 0.43 along two axes, no rigid motion at
  all) makes its whole instance blend entrywise (each vertex in a straight line) for that interval
  instead of tearing.
- The judder detector's ideal follows the same rules. (A polar decomposition instead of
  Gram-Schmidt for sheared envelope matrices was tried: no measurable change, not kept.)

- Event scenes (own camera, merged with "Event scenes: models far from their origin"): the
  per-draw pivot of that fix is not applied on top of the screw blend (the screw already turns
  each matrix about its own motion's axis, the same axis for neighbouring pieces; moving each
  piece's centre in a straight line on top opened the seams of Luigi's glove in the opening map
  scene; `LM_OWNCAM_PIVOT=1` brings it back), its switch test ("moves more than a tenth of its
  distance") measures at the geometry, not at the origin 4000-5600 units away, and its pivot uses
  the slot's vertex centre when it is on. Skinned own-camera instances still blend entrywise.

**Results** (path check, 180 s of the heavy mix per run from game frame 2600, 120 fps target
unless noted, off-screen 1280x720, default settings; the machine was shared with other agents'
game instances, so presented rates were 55-80 fps; "events" = game frames with at least one
jumping vertex; old = the same build with `LM_SCREW_BLEND=0`):

What is left: in the ghost fights (Luigi pulled about by a ghost) 3 game frames in 3 minutes
where a few vertices of Luigi's body or hose leave their path by 3-12 units mid-interval (no
switch; matrices turning 40-80 degrees while their weights change by less than the 30% rule); in
the boss arena one particle renderer's particles (`fn_80162898`) switch for a place jump. Old
first-build numbers of the run scenario before each step (2 minutes, nursery): origin blend 525
events (308 at the nozzle) -> screw blend 74 (13) -> no untwist, centres, steady members 22 (5)
-> slot centres 7 (2) -> outliers by centre, half turns, rescales 0.

Whole scene (`--radius 1e9`: every object vertex in view, foyer, 120 s): old 39,321 flagged
vertices, new 48; the judder detector (1.5 px) 0 blend defects in both, policy jumps 35-408 per
5 s old, 0 new. Event scenes (own camera, `--radius 1e9`, about 8 s each): the opening map scene
old (`LM_SCREW_BLEND=0 LM_OWNCAM_INSTANCES=0`) 3300 flagged vertices in 51 game frames, new 118
in 14 (all in frames 1569-1600, models placed anew by >1000 units, shown at the game frame by
design; none in the map frames 1395-1500); the lab's walk-up demo old 7255, new 0-59.

Original 30 is byte-identical: 71 frames (2690-2760) of the run mix at a 30 target, main's
executable (8b7a97f) vs this branch, 0 differ. The new code runs only while tapes are captured,
and the path check only with `LM_TRACK_LOG`.

Rerun: `python tools/interp/hose_suite.py <out> --scenario run --scenario foyer --scenario fire
--scenario water --scenario ice --scenario hit --scenario ghosts --scenario boss --fps 120 --secs
180` (add `--env LM_SCREW_BLEND=0` for the old rules, `--fps 60 --fps 144`, `--user-settings
--window 2560x1440`, `--radius 1e9` for the whole scene, `--scenario opening` / `event --secs 8`
for the event scenes); each run prints `hose_check.py`'s summary and a table at the end. The runs
never open a physical controller (SDL joystick backends off in their environment).
Frame strips (LM_PRESENT_DUMP, 60 fps, frames 3102-3105 of the run mix, old vs new):
`out/hose_jump/` in the main checkout (not in the repository).

### Results (first build, October 2026)

Test mode (`LM_INTERP_TEST=3`, 640x480 dumps; metrics.py and tint.py; "before" = the heuristic design):

| scenario | stale px | snap blobs start / end | back-and-forth | tint (in-betweens outside both neighbours) | detector |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| foyer strafing 2600-2700 | 0 | 28,368 / 28,083 (before 26,598 / 22,642) | **18,080** (before 31,913) | 7 of 198 (tiles only: Luigi's instant turn moves the lit area) | 0 blend errors; 36 snapped (instant turns) |
| foyer, enhanced lighting Ultra | 0 | 56,269 / 78,840 | 27,981 | flare frames (see above) | 0 blend errors; 54 snapped |
| vacuum, heavy dust 2655-2662 | 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 | 0 of 12 | 0 |
| nursery 2600-2780 (lightning) | 0 | 765,857 / 84,985 (lightning, lights on) | **54,247** (before 63,749) | lightning frames | |
| Boolossus (map 11) 2600-2700 | 0 | 9,765 / 2,546 | 20,040 | 6 of 198 (tiles) | 0 blend errors; snapped: joints flipping >150 degrees |

Live (judder detector every 3rd in-between, 120 target): vacuum scene 0 of ~1.27 M judged draws per
5 s off by more than 1.5 px; gold ghosts room with fire and enhanced lighting Ultra (9 min): 0 blend
errors. Original 30: 41 foyer frames byte-identical to main. Pacing (hidden window): 60.00 fps at 60,
116.40 at 120 (as main); tape close 0.6 ms (before 1.4-2.6 ms).

User session 1 (4K, 120 Hz, enhanced lighting Ultra): "things were looking exceptionally smooth, I
didn't notice anything looking wrong or juddering". Fixed after the sessions: hook overhead
(`callOriginal` cached: the game logic had dropped to 18-25 Hz in heavy scenes), HUD judder (2D
projections were paired by order and blended across HUD elements; now never blended).

## History: the heuristic design (passes 1-5)

The sections below describe the design that tagged interpolation replaced. Their pairing,
fade, swarm and blink parts no longer apply; the pacing, copies, camera factoring, shadow and
measurement parts still do.

## What was wrong (stability)

Measured with the deterministic test mode below in the nursery (`LM_START_MAP=2
LM_START_APPEAR=1`, Luigi walking with scripted stick input):

1. **Vertex data read after the game had changed it (the popping/vanishing objects).** A tape
   referenced the game's vertex arrays by pointer, and Aurora read them when the tape was
   replayed, while the guest was already building the next frame. Luigi's body (vertex data the
   game rewrites every frame) was drawn from half-rebuilt memory: in the A/B run
   (`LM_INTERP_ARRAYS=0`) his body disappears entirely from replays of some frames (frame 2608:
   only the hose and Poltergust remain, ~3300 pixels wrong), and which frames are hit depends on
   timing, so in real play it flickers. Original 30 never shows it because there the frame is
   drawn before the guest continues.
2. **Matrices paired by source address and occurrence.** The game builds many matrices in
   per-frame pools (e.g. 0x814E1000), so "the n-th load from address X into slot Y" is not
   necessarily the same object from one frame to the next when the set of drawn objects changes;
   such pairs blend one object toward another's position. (The pixel metrics could not separate
   this from the other causes; the trace shows pool matrices whose partner is thousands of units
   away.)
3. **Too-tight jump thresholds and entrywise blending.** Rotation entries changing by more than
   0.35 or translations by more than 400 units were shown unblended. That snapped Luigi's limbs
   and body whenever he turned (about 20-25 degrees per game frame), and far objects whenever the
   camera turned (they move a lot in view space), while everything around them was blended:
   visible as jitter. Texture-projection matrices (the flashlight's projected texture) were
   compared relative to entries that pass through zero, so about 300 per frame snapped.
   Blending matrix entries linearly also shrinks a turning object at the in-between frames.

## What it does now

- **Vertex-array copies** (`interp_vtx.cpp`). While capturing, every draw is parsed: display
  lists at `GXCallDisplayList`, and the raw vertex stream after `GXBegin` (game code writes it
  through the write-gather pipe). For each indexed attribute the highest index gives the range
  of the array the draw reads; that range is copied at the time of the draw (when the console's
  GPU would read it), and the tape's array-base commands are pointed at the copies (with their
  size, so Aurora uploads exactly the copy). Copies are shared per address until
  `GXInvalidateVtxCache`, after which the current arrays are loaded again so later draws get fresh
  copies. Every tape starts by loading the current arrays, so it never depends on another tape.
  Indexed matrix loads (`LOAD_INDX`) extend the matrix arrays the same way. About 1.2 MB of copies
  per game frame in a room.
- **Pairing by draw.** The values noted before a draw (position/normal/texture matrices,
  projection, lights) and the draw's own CPU-built vertices form a *bundle*, identified by what is
  drawn (display-list address and size, or primitive + vertex layout + position array for
  immediate draws) and by the kinds and sizes of its values. Bundles of the same identity are
  paired between frames, closest values first (rotation weighted against translation, a sprite's
  texture spin weighted strongly), then their values one by one. XF slots are deliberately not
  part of the identity: J3D hands out matrix slots per frame. Where many draws share an identity
  (particles), the common motion (the camera's, in view space) is taken out first and a draw may
  move at most 12 units plus 1% of its distance on its own: a particle that died and one born
  elsewhere are never paired, they just disappear/appear. What is left is paired by (kind, source
  address) only where that is unambiguous. Pairing runs once per tape on the guest thread (about
  0.6 ms including the copy bookkeeping). `LM_INTERP_PAIRING=source` uses only address pairing,
  for comparison.
- **Blending.** Position and normal matrices are split into rotation (quaternion, slerp) and an
  upper-triangular scale/shear part (Gram-Schmidt), so turning objects keep their shape and
  sheared matrices from non-uniformly scaled parents still blend. A pair is shown unblended
  (snapped) when the rotation is over ~150 degrees in one game frame (no telling which way it
  turned), a scale changes over 2x, or the translation jumps by more than half its distance from
  the camera (at least 200 units): teleports, respawns, wrong pairs.
- **Camera cuts.** If more than half of a tape's paired position matrices jump, the whole tape is
  shown as is. LM hides room changes and warps behind fades, so no smear was seen there.
- **Spawn/despawn.** A value with no partner is drawn as captured.

## Interpolating everything

- **Lights**: `GXLoadLightObjImm` position and direction (view space) are blended per light
  slot, the direction keeping its length (spot-cone falloff).
- **Texture matrices**: projection-style ones (flashlight projector, shadows) are blended
  row-wise; the rows are compared by their rotation/scale part only. Matrices that alternate with
  zero matrices are never blended toward zero. 2x4 matrices that spin texture coordinates in their
  plane (particle sprites) are blended by angle and scale about their pivot (up to ~150 degrees per
  game frame). Other small texture-coordinate matrices snap on a wrap (an entry jumping by more
  than 0.5).
- **Billboards and particles**: camera-facing sprites (the particle system's one-quad display
  lists, J3D billboards such as the spiderwebs) have no rotation in view space; slerp keeps it that
  way, so they stay camera-facing at every in-between frame while their positions, sizes and
  spins are blended.
- **CPU-built geometry**: immediate-mode draws under a perspective projection with direct float
  XYZ positions are noted as vertex blocks and paired by layout, vertex count and the nearest
  first vertices; positions are blended (a block moving more than 200 units snaps).
- **EFB-copy effects** are replayed with the rest of the tape, so they show the interpolated
  scene.

## Test mode and evidence

`LM_INTERP_TEST=<steps>` with `LM_FRAME_DUMP=<dir>,<first>,<last>`: the guest waits after each
game frame N while the host renders, with guest memory as it is at the end of N:
`fN_fresh.ppm` (tape N as captured = the 30 Hz frame) and `fN-1_s1..s<steps>.ppm` (frames N-2 to
N-1 at alpha s/steps; `s<steps>` is tape N-1 replayed one game frame late, as in real play).
With `LM_INTERP_TRACE=1` it also logs, per frame, what was snapped (with values) and pairing
statistics. Scripts used for the numbers below (pixel metrics on these dumps) are not in the
repo; the checks are:

- *stale*: pixels where `fN_s<steps>` differs from `fN_fresh` (a late replay must look exactly
  like the 30 Hz frame). 100 walking frames: 3308 with `LM_INTERP_ARRAYS=0` (Luigi's body
  missing), **0** with the copies. On main after the shadows merge (703f378) frame 2608 shows
  3161 again, with or without the copies: there Luigi's body is missing from the *fresh* replay
  and present in the late one, and the same body dropout happens in Original 30 (frames
  2608-2609, also with `LM_EFB_RAM=0` and the shadow options off). So it is not interpolation
  but GX state the frame inherits from the previous one (a fresh replay starts from the previous
  frame's end state, like the console; the late replay starts from its own end state); to be
  looked at with the shadow/GX accuracy work.
- *billboard tracking* (`LM_INTERP_TRACE` "match" lines): camera-facing sprites followed over
  three tapes; "jerky" = the middle position is far off the line through its neighbours (a wrong
  pair). 100 walking frames in the nursery, ~33,000 sprites tracked: 7,709 jerky with address
  pairing, 5,274 with the first per-draw pairing (large groups paired in order), **827** now.
- *snapped*: blobs that jump all at once between fN-1_fresh and fN_s1 and then stay. Over 100
  walking frames these are now almost only Luigi's instant 180-degree turns (the game turns him
  within one frame: nothing to interpolate) and the flashlight switching on. Position matrices
  shown unblended per frame went from ~90 (entrywise thresholds) to ~25 (rotation/shear
  blending); texture matrices from ~300 to ~50 (the remaining ones are 2D texture rotations of
  more than 90 degrees per frame). With per-draw bundles and sprite spins (October 2026) the
  nursery walk is at ~6 position and ~6 texture matrices per frame, and the pixel blobs that
  snap at the start of an in-between dropped from 166,000 to 18,000 pixels over 100 frames (what
  is left is Luigi's instant turns).
- Teleport (`LM_SKIP_TEST=2700:pos:...`) and warp (`LM_DEV_WARPS=2:3@2700`): no smearing; the
  room change happens under the fade.

Performance (RTX 3090 Ti, i9-12900KS, nursery, walking): 60.0 fps presented at a 60 target,
game 29.6-30.1 fps; tape ~600 KiB + ~1.2 MiB array copies per game frame; 1.1 ms guest time per
tape, 0.4 ms host time per present for the blended replay.

Test aids added with interp-everything: `LM_INTERP_NOBLEND=<mask>` shows the value kinds of the
mask (bit = `interp::Kind`: 0 position, 1 normal, 2 texture matrices, 3 projections, 4 lights,
5 CPU-built vertices, 6 colors) as captured, to find which kind causes an artifact;
`LM_INTERP_POISON=<item>,<phys>,<size>` (hex) fills that
guest memory with garbage during one `LM_INTERP_TEST` replay (e.g. `f2762_fresh`): if the replay
changes, it still reads that memory live (bisect the range); the trace logs a self-check of the
camera-factored and shadow-receiver values at alpha 1, the values without partner (with their draw
identity) and the camera cuts with eye move/turn.

## Dust and spiderwebs (October 2026)

User report: with interpolation on, the dust Luigi kicks up and the spiderwebs misbehaved.
`LM_INTERP_DRAWS=<first>[,<last>]` (frame numbers as in `LM_FRAME_DUMP`) logs every draw of
those tapes with its guest call chain, the values noted before it, and what each was paired
with.

- **Spiderwebs** (nursery, foyer) are J3D draws (`draw__8J3DShapeCFv`) of camera-facing
  billboards. J3D loads their matrices into whichever XF slots are free that frame (slots 6/9/12/15
  in one frame, 15/18/21/24 in the next), and pairing used the slot as part of the key, so they
  never found a partner and were drawn as captured: they moved in 30 Hz steps while the room
  around them moved smoothly (template tracking in the dumps: web +4 px at once, wall +1 px per
  in-between; now both +1 px per in-between).
- **Dust and other particle effects** come from the game's particle system (`fn_8012FD14`): every
  particle is the same 32-byte quad display list with a billboard position matrix and a spinning
  2x4 texture matrix, all loaded from one scratch address. About 180 such draws per frame were
  one group, too large for the nearest-value pairing then (it fell back to pairing in draw
  order, which shifts whenever a particle dies or spawns), so puffs were blended toward other
  puffs (flying across the cloud, stretching, doubling). Their texture spins (30-90 degrees per
  frame) also snapped. Now particles are paired as whole draws with the camera motion taken out,
  spins are blended by angle, and new/dead particles are left unpaired.
- A field-order bug in the value records also gave CPU-built vertex blocks a stride of 1, so they
  were never blended (they always snapped as "too far"); fixed.
- The scanner now sizes immediate-mode vertices with the layout as it was at `GXBegin` (the game
  changes it right after `GXEnd`); the "unparsed stream" (a full-screen 2D quad) is gone.

## Fixes from the SMS port (October 2026)

- Aurora 0022: `GXEnd`'s "vertex data not evenly divisible" check measures the draw in the
  calling thread's recording, not the FIFO (which the host replaying tapes appends to and
  resets). The draws were fine; the warnings were noise (LM: sporadic, 4-5 in some 60 fps runs,
  none in the A/B runs, so the reduction is not measured here).
- Immediate draws with direct positions: the draw identity no longer includes the bound
  `GX_VA_POS` array (stale for direct positions). In LM's nursery the CPU-built vertex blocks
  already paired (7.2 of 7.9 per tape before and after), so this changes nothing there; it keeps
  LM safe if a direct-position draw follows indexed ones with changing arrays.
- Light jump limit relative to distance (at least 400 units, else half the light's distance),
  and non-finite light values never blended or rescaled.
- Camera cuts to a nearby viewpoint: a tape is also a cut when the median relative move of its
  paired position matrices exceeds 0.08 and four times the previous tape's (`Tape::camStep`;
  `LM_INTERP_TRACE` logs "scene step"). In the opening cutscene it catches two shot changes the
  half-of-matrices test missed (scene step 0.34 / 0.39 after ~0.003); gameplay walking in the
  nursery and foyer stays at 0.04 or less (no false cuts).

Measured with `LM_INTERP_TEST` (nursery walk at 60 and 120 fps, 210 frames each; foyer walk at
60 fps, 160 frames): 0 stale pixels before and after; pairing statistics (position matrices,
billboards, vertex blocks, jerky counts) within run-to-run noise of main.

(Fixed by interp-everything, texture copies and copy generations: 0 stale pixels over frames
1880-2120.) Was open: in the attract-mode opening (crows on the branch, the second-to-last frame of that shot)
the late replay of one tape draws the lit models darker than its fresh replay (88,685 px; the sky
and grass are unchanged). It is the same with `LM_NO_SHADOW=1`, `LM_EFB_RAM=0` and with or
without the replay state slots, so it is neither the shadow pass, copies to RAM nor carried GX
state; display lists and vertex arrays are copied into the tape. Remaining suspects: data Aurora
still reads by pointer at replay time (textures and TLUTs via `GX_AURORA_LOAD_TEXOBJ`), which the
game may already have replaced for the next shot.

## Cost of closing a tape (guest thread)

Pairing runs on the game thread when a tape is closed, so it eats into the 33 ms game frame.
The 5-second `[interp]` stats line reports it as `tape close X ms (guest: arrays, copy, draws,
rest, cut)`: vertex-array bookkeeping, copying the tape, pairing draws, pairing leftover values by
source, and the camera-cut check.

In the foyer (~3,300 values per tape) the per-draw pairing took 13.4 ms: groups of 448, 224 and
125 identical particle draws were compared all-pairs (up to 200,000 candidate pairs per group,
every one sorted, including the ones rejected by the motion limit), and every draw's position was
re-read from the tape for every comparison. Now (paired/unpaired counts unchanged within
run-to-run noise):
- each draw's position is read once; the common motion is the median over at most 64 sampled
  draws instead of all of them;
- in groups of more than 1,024 pairs, only predecessors within the motion limit are visited
  (sorted along the axis the group is most spread out on, then a range scan), so a draw has a
  handful of candidates instead of hundreds; rejected pairs are never stored;
- particles (one CPU-built vertex block per draw) have their first vertices decoded once per
  group, and candidates are sorted as packed integer keys;
- the per-draw index lists are one flat array (one allocation instead of one per draw).

Foyer: tape close 13.7 ms -> 1.05 ms (draws 13.4 -> 0.8 ms; copy 0.1-0.2 ms); opening cutscene
and title 0.1-0.3 ms.

## Everything interpolates (interp-everything, October 2026)

Goal: every visible thing moves smoothly between the 30 Hz game frames, a replay never shows
memory the game has already changed, and shadows are both smooth and stable. Parts marked
**generic** carry over to other games on the same runtime (SMS); the rest is LM glue.

### Test scenarios and metrics

`tools/interp/scenarios.sh <out dir> <scenario> [fps] [steps]` runs one with a scratch
APPDATA/`LM_CARD_DIR`, `LM_INTERP_TEST=3` (fresh replay + two in-betweens + late replay per game
frame, see below), `LM_INTERP_TRACE=1` and its deterministic `--input`, and prints
`tools/interp/metrics.py`'s summary (`LM_DISC`, `LM_PYTHON` with numpy + Pillow):

| Scenario | What happens | Frames |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| nursery (`LM_START_MAP=2 LM_START_APPEAR=1`, `LM_LIGHTNING=0,90,1`) | walking, fast turns (stick reversals), nozzle aiming (C stick), flashlight, lightning strikes with shadows, GBH open/close (Y), dust, spiderwebs, door to the next room | 2580-2960 |
| ghosts: gold ghosts room (`LM_TELEPORT=0,550,-3300,100`, `LM_GHOST_HUNT=9 ...`, see RENDERING.md) | ghosts appear, hover, attack, vanish; stun, vacuum, capture | 3280-3600 |
| opening (title, `--input "600:START*10,1000:A*6"`, nothing skipped) | the attract/opening cutscene: crows, camera cuts, gate, foyer entrance | 1880-2120 |
| fire: nursery, fire element (`LM_TEST_STATE=poltergust+fire`) | fire blown (L), vacuum (R) with its air stream and dust, turns | 2580-2920 |
| water | as D with the water element | 2580-2920 |
| ballroom (`LM_TELEPORT=1800,0,-1400,100`) | ballroom, quick left/right turns, nozzle aiming, walking | 2580-2900 |

Per game frame (from the dumps; pixel threshold 40/255, blobs = after a 2-pixel erosion so
edges that legitimately move one pixel per in-between are not counted):
- **stale**: pixels where the late replay differs from the fresh one (must be 0);
- **snap blobs**: regions that change completely between the previous frame and the first
  in-between and then stay (something shown unblended), or only at the last step;
- **back-and-forth**: pixels whose brightness goes up and then down (or the reverse) by more than
  24 within one interval (inconsistent blends, e.g. a shadow sliding away and back);
- per in-between, the values shown unblended (snapped) and the values without partner.

### What changed

1. **Textures and TLUTs are copied at capture time** (`interp_tex.cpp`, generic). A replay read
   texel data by pointer when it first needed a texture; a late replay could find the memory
   already reused. Every `GXLoadTexObj`/`GXLoadTlut` in a tape now points at a capture-time copy
   (shared by texture object + data version, else by content hash, so a texture is copied once).
   Textures go through Aurora patch 0028's new *content* pointer, so they keep their address for
   EFB-copy lookups. A texture over memory an EFB copy wrote is left to Aurora's copy paths only
   while that memory still holds what it held at the copy (hashed at the copy and at the load;
   copy-to-RAM writebacks update the hash); the GBH, for one, later loads ordinary textures into a
   buffer it once copied the screen into.
2. **Normals bound through `GX_VA_NBT`** were not tracked by the vertex-array copies (the slot was
   computed from the attribute number, 25), so bump-mapped models (the GBH body, ...) were drawn
   from live memory. Found by poisoning guest memory during a replay and bisecting the range
   (`LM_INTERP_POISON`). Generic.
3. **EFB copies per replay** (Aurora 0028 `GX_AURORA_COPY_GENERATION`, generic). A replayed tape
   re-runs its EFB copies; they used to overwrite the same copy textures the tape's own early draws
   read (copies made in the previous frame), so every replay after the first showed the frame's
   own copies where the previous frame's belonged. Copies now go into one of four generations
   (the tape's sequence number), and the replay state slots (0021) save/restore the copy-texture
   map and Aurora's copy-to-RAM entries with the rest of the state. During replays copies are not
   dropped for memory the CPU changed (the guest is on a later frame by then).
4. **Copy-to-RAM readbacks only from the first replay of a tape.** Every replay wrote the frame's
   copies back into guest memory again, up to a frame later, over memory the game may have reused
   meanwhile (the GBH's screen-capture buffer holds GBH model data once it closes): guest memory
   corruption, visible as the GBH vanishing while it closes. Generic (Aurora 0028, bit 6).
5. **Colors blend** (generic): channel ambient/material colors, light colors, TEV color and
   konst registers (also when a display list sets them), fog color. They belong to their draw and
   are paired through the draw pairing (the n-th write of a register for that draw). Lightning
   flashes and fades now fade at the presented rate instead of in 30 Hz steps.
6. **Camera factoring** (generic; LM supplies the view matrix address, `interp::viewMatrixSource`
   in shadows.cpp: the game camera's GX view matrix, `lbl_803A3820 + 0x18C`). Every position/normal
   matrix and light is noted with the camera it was drawn under (sampled from guest memory at the
   load, so the shadow pass is factored by the light's camera). A model-view matrix is blended as
   blended camera x blended world matrix: the scene moves as one rigid whole (each product used
   to follow its own path in view space), billboards stay exactly camera-facing, far objects keep
   their distance while the camera turns. Draws are paired by their world-space positions, and
   draws of different passes (main, shadow caster) are kept apart.
7. **Shadows: smooth and stable** (LM; `LM_SHADOW_SNAP=3`, the new default). The caster pass is
   factored by the light camera LV and blended like everything else, so the shadow map is
   re-rendered at every presented frame from the blended light and casters. The receivers' shadow
   texture matrices T = K x G (K = the game's light projection or depth-ramp matrix x LV, read from
   the shadow object after the caster setup; G = the receiver's world matrix, or the inverse view
   the game built the actors' post-transform matrices with) are rebuilt as K(t) x G(t) with
   K(t) = P(t) x LV(t) from the same blended light. G is solved from the projection matrix of the
   same draw (the depth-ramp K is singular). In test mode a self-check rebuilds every factored
   value at alpha 1 and compares it with the captured one (`self-check: 0 of N ... differ`).
   `LM_SHADOW_SNAP=1` keeps the old 30 Hz shadows.
8. **2D is interpolated** (generic): HUD panes, screen transitions and dialogue boxes are paired
   per draw like 3D (not camera-factored); a 2D matrix that jumps more than 96 units snaps.
9. **Camera cuts from the game camera** (generic): a tape is a cut when the camera the most
   position matrices were drawn under moves its eye by more than 250 units or turns by more than
   30 degrees in one game frame (the matrix-based tests stay as a fallback). In the opening
   cutscene this catches all five shot changes; walking and turning stay far below.
10. **Lights stay themselves**: a GX light slot holds whichever light object the game loaded for
    that draw; a light is blended only with the same light object of the previous frame, and its
    color only when its position was blended (a lamp's color at the flashlight's position made the
    in-between frames brighter than both neighbours in the water scenario). Values drawn from a
    camera that jumped (the shadow pass when another light takes over: flashlight, room light,
    lightning, a spray) are shown as captured, and so are the receivers' shadow matrices.
11. **Pairing within a draw**: a skinned model that loads its joints in another order the next
    frame (index pairing would make them jump) is paired nearest-first instead. Scale changes blend
    up to 16x (particles growing, eyelids closing); environment/reflection texture matrices blend
    like rotations unless their translation wraps.

### Results

Before (main at the start of this work, 55748e4) and after, same scenarios and frames (snapped and
unpaired are averages per in-between frame over all value kinds; "snap blobs" include the
game's own instant events: lightning strikes, the GBH opening/closing cut, the flashlight or room
lights switching on, a fire burst appearing):

| | stale px | snap blobs | back-and-forth | snapped / in-between | unpaired / in-between |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nursery, before | 83,150 (GBH closing frame) | 1,015,870 | (not measured) | 1.8 | 23.2 |
| nursery, after | **0** | 640,861 (412,806 are 3 instant events: lightning strike, GBH open/close cuts) | 63,810 (snapped shadows: 68,317) | 4.3 | 32.4 |
| ghosts, after | **0** | 135,006 (52,681 the flashlight going off/on for the vacuum) | 28,592 | 3.8 | 38.2 |
| opening, after | **0** (the crow frame had 88,685) | 118,614 (the shot changes, all detected as cuts) | 11,087 (texture detail sliding under the moving camera) | 0.0 | 4.2 |
| fire, after | **0** | 599,103 (room lights on, fire bursts appearing) | 30,076 | 14.9 | 45.0 |
| water, after | **0** | 708,590 (room lights on, spray starting) | 63,009 | 19.6 | 70.1 (13 are spray droplets moving too fast to pair) |
| ballroom, after | **0** | 254,740 | 35,786 | 2.0 | 42.3 |

More values are interpolated now (colors, 2D, the shadow caster pass), so the snapped/unpaired
counts per frame are not comparable to before one to one; per tape about 1.5% of ~5,300 values
have no partner (spawns, despawns, the frame a light or effect switches) and ~0.1% are shown
unblended.

Shadows: with the old blending (`LM_SHADOW_SNAP=0`) the flashlight shadows slid back and forth
(documented in RENDERING.md); snapped (`=1`) they were stable but moved at 30 Hz (all of a
shadow edge's change lands on the first in-between: counted in the snap blobs); now (`=3`) they
move with the presented frame and the back-and-forth count over scenario A is at the snapped
level (63,773 vs 68,317; the first attempt, with the actors' receivers rebuilt from the sampled
camera, had 400,650 and the self-check showed 124 mismatching values per frame, now 0).
Original 30 is byte-identical to main (17 dumped frames of scenario A at 30 fps, incl. lightning,
GBH and the door, compared pixel by pixel with main's executable: 0 pixels differ).

### Cost

Nursery walk (scenario A without test mode), RTX 3090 Ti, 120 Hz display with VSync: target
120 -> 120.0 fps presented (240 -> 120: the display), game 29.8-30.2 fps. Per game frame: tape
~630 KiB + vertex-array copies ~360 KiB; texture copies are made once per texture (4 KiB per
frame while walking, a few MiB when a room loads). Tape close (guest thread) 1.4-2.6 ms, of which
pairing 1.1-2.3 ms (up from ~1 ms: colors, more values per draw); replay 0.7-0.8 ms per presented
frame (host). About 5,300 values paired per tape, 60-130 without partner, 1-7 shown unblended per
presented frame.

## Polish: fades, particles, shadow depth (interp-polish, October 2026)

1. **Spawns and despawns fade** (generic; Aurora patch `0030-interp-fades`). A draw without a
   partner used to pop in at the first in-between frame (spawns) or vanish there (despawns).
   - `GX_AURORA_SET_FADE q` makes later draws drop q/255 of their pixels with a 4x4 ordered
     dither (the fragment shader discards; the amount rides in bits 8..15 of the per-draw
     `current_pnmtx` immediate, so no pipeline or uniform changes). Dither instead of alpha works
     for opaque and blended draws alike and keeps depth right; at 120+ fps it reads as a fade.
   - Fade-in: each 3D main-pass draw of b without a partner (a model-view matrix or CPU-built
     vertices, none paired) is bracketed by `SET_FADE (1 - alpha)` / `SET_FADE 0` in the replayed
     stream (draw byte ranges are recorded at capture: a display list's inlined bytes, an
     immediate draw from its setup to its last vertex).
   - Fade-out: a's draws without a partner are drawn again from a's own commands, so their state
     (textures, TEV, lights, arrays) is a's. `GX_AURORA_SET_REPLAY_MASK` runs a's commands with
     draws, EFB copies, offscreen passes, depth snapshots, extra lights and texture evictions
     skipped; only the vanished draws are unmasked, at `SET_FADE alpha`. The pass is spliced into
     b's stream after the draw paired with the closest earlier paired draw of a, between state
     slot 4 (b's state, saved and restored around it) and slot 5 (a's state so far: starts as the
     end state of a's predecessor; slots 4..7 hold GX state only). At most 8 passes per replay,
     in a's order.
   - Values without partner (spawned draws, vanished draws) are placed under the blended camera
     (their world placement seen from the in-between camera), so they move with the scene.
   - Not faded: draws sampling an EFB copy (the TEV reads a copy destination; screen effects that
     redraw the frame, the GBH screen, shadow receivers: fading a full-screen redraw of the frame
     darkened the whole picture on the lights-on frame), the shadow caster pass, 2D, and cut frames.
   - `LM_INTERP_FADES=0|in|out` (test aid) turns them off or keeps one direction.
2. **Fast particles pair by predicted position** (generic). For groups of many draws of one
   kind, each draw of a is expected where its own motion since its predecessor carries it (falls
   back to the group's common motion); candidates are limited and, for CPU-built particles,
   ranked by the distance from that prediction. Water spray droplets (point sprites) without
   partner went from 13.0 to 10.4 per in-between frame (the rest are born or die and now fade).
3. **Shadow depth from b** ("shadows at any distance" refits the light's near/far every frame,
   and the depth ramp is not linear in them): the caster pass's projection keeps b's depth terms
   (x/y blended) and the receivers' ramp matrix uses b's projection with the blended light view,
   so caster depth and receiver ramp always use the same near/far.
4. **New scenarios** (`tools/interp/scenarios.sh`): `call` (E. Gadd's GBH call: call screen,
   portrait, four message windows), `pause` (pause screen, its pages, back), `ending` (ending
   scene, rank A, caption fade). Env: `LM_RANGE`, `LM_SECS`, `LM_EXTRA_INI` (e.g. enhanced lighting
   and world lights), `LM_EXE` (another build), steps 0 = a real-time run.

Results (same metrics as above; "before" = the interp-everything results):

| | stale px | snap blobs | back-and-forth | snapped / in-between | unpaired / in-between | fades in/out |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nursery | 0 | 639,731 (before 640,863) | 63,749 (64,824) | 4.3 | 32.4 | 6.7 / 5.7 |
| ghosts | 0 | 39,413 (131,433) | 25,142 (28,230) | 3.0 | 12.8 (36.8) | 2.6 / 2.3 |
| opening | 0 | 126,450 (126,450) | 11,137 (11,137) | 0.0 | 4.1 | 0 / 0 |
| fire | 0 | 684,471 (630,933; room lights on, fire burst: game events) | 27,484 (31,919) | 14.3 | 48.3 | 8.3 / 7.5 |
| water | 0 | 594,325 (647,350) | 57,155 (89,140) | 20.3 | 70.4 (13 droplets -> 10.4) | 22.1 / 20.4 |
| ballroom | 0 | 242,973 (254,740) | 36,694 (35,786) | 2.0 | 38.3 (42.3) | 5.3 / 5.0 |
| call | 0 | 95,865 | 6,829 | 1.8 | 11.9 | 2.2 / 2.0 |
| pause | 0 | 368,019 (opening/closing the pause screen) | 4,713 | 1.1 | 16.6 | 1.8 / 0.5 |
| ending | 0 | 1,081 | 0 | 0.0 | 1.1 | 0 / 0.1 |
| ballroom + enhanced lighting, world lights, light shadow maps, 120 / 240 | 0 / 0 | 263,675 / 262,684 | 35,820 / 35,669 | 2.0 | 38.3 | 5.3 / 5.0 |

- Fades do not add dither noise to the back-and-forth metric (nursery 63,775 without, 63,749 with).
- The call's message windows, the pause screen and the ending caption interpolate (their opening
  and closing are the game's own one-frame events). The message window appears in one frame and
  is not faded (2D).
- Light shadow maps and world lights: the same tape at 120 and 240 targets gives the same metrics;
  they are rebuilt per replay from blended lights and casters.
- Original 30 is byte-identical to main (19 frames of the nursery scenario at 30 fps, main's
  executable vs this branch: 0 pixels differ).
- Scheduler changes (guest threads release the CPU during the frame handoff, GXDrawDone and DVD
  waits): a decoupled guest records and closes its tapes as before (the present path never waits
  for the host); real-time nursery run at 120: alpha rises monotonically within a tape (5 of
  2,000 presents stepped back), tape close 1.7-4 ms on a machine shared with two other runs.

## Pass 3: pacing, presentation cost, pairing, blinks (interp-pass-3, October 2026)

User report after a full playthrough at high frame rates: "many things still judder frequently
while moving" (easiest to see: the foyer candlesticks and door while Luigi strafes with the camera
following), parts of Luigi (the flashlight) blink out, and the damage blink looks wrong.

### What was wrong

1. **Presentation collapsed in heavy rooms** (the static door and candlesticks judder). A replay is
   processed by Aurora's FIFO thread inside `aurora_end_frame` (drain). In the foyer that took
   ~25 ms per present, so a 120 target presented at ~36 fps: frames landed on alternating 3 and 4
   refreshes of the 120 Hz display, and everything that moves on screen (the whole room under a
   moving camera) juddered. The cause was the early-Z accuracy split (Aurora 0170/0179, F1 >
   Visuals > Rendering "Early depth for cut-out textures"): ~16,000 draws per foyer frame were
   split into a depth-only and a colour pass, each with two whole-config pipeline lookups, and the
   0179 fix stopped consecutive draws from merging, so every triangle strip became two draw
   commands. Measured (FIFO drain per present, foyer, 120 target): 25-30 ms with the split,
   3.7-8 ms with it off.
2. **Alpha from the guest's finish time** (`LM_INTERP_PACING=old`). alpha = (now - time tape b was
   finished) / (b's stamp step): every in-between depended on when the game thread happened to
   finish its frame (+-4 ms of work jitter), and the frame stamps (the retrace count at the
   present) step 1 or 3 fields instead of 2 whenever a frame's work crosses a retrace (3-4% of
   frames in the foyer): alpha then reached 1 after half the time and held (a stall), or jumped.
3. **Luigi's draws lost their partners when he started moving.** The polish pass predicted where a
   draw would be from its own motion in the previous frame (fast particles) and rejected partners
   more than 12 units (+1% of the distance) away. That also applied to models drawn a few times per
   frame (Luigi is drawn in several passes, so his draws are "many"): on his first walking frame
   all 231 of his position matrices (body, Poltergust, hose, flashlight) were unpaired, vanished
   and reappeared as a whole: the flashlight blinking out, and a stray flashlight cone across the
   room in the in-betweens (his vanished draws re-expressed under the wrong camera: the camera of
   a tape was mapped to the other tape's by the first paired value).
4. **Blinks became fades.** Draws without a partner faded with a dither (polish pass) and color
   registers were always blended, so anything the game switches on and off per frame passed
   through half-states that neither frame shows.

### What it does now

1. **Aurora 0192** (`patches/aurora/0192-early-z-split-cache-merge.patch`): the split decision and
   its two pipelines are cached with the draw cache, and while interpolating
   (`GX_AURORA_ACCURACY_EARLY_Z_MERGE`, set by `gx::applyAccuracySettings` when the frame-rate
   target is above 30) consecutive draws with the same state merge into one split pair (both halves
   extended alike). Foyer FIFO drain per present: 25-30 ms -> ~11 ms (cache) -> **3.9 ms**
   (merged). The merged pair differs from the per-draw order only where merged geometry overlaps
   itself with alpha-rejected pixels: nursery test-mode dumps, merged vs exact, 578 px in 345
   frames (edges of the Game Boy Horror hand, max 28 levels). Original 30 keeps the exact split.
   `AURORA_EARLY_Z_MERGE=0/1/ab` overrides.
2. **Presentation clock** (`interp.cpp`, `Pacer`, `pace()`). Tapes go into a queue; per present:
   - a smoothed present clock (advances by the measured present period, pulled 10% toward the
     real time, resynchronized when a present is more than 4 ms off: a missed refresh);
   - a game timeline: each tape one nominal step (median of the recent stamp steps, 2 fields at 30
     fps) after its predecessor, pulled 10% toward its stamp; a stamp more than 1.5 fields off (a
     real slowdown, a load) is taken as is;
   - the shown game time G = clock - D, where the delay D covers the slowest recent tape (finish
     time minus its predecessor's game time, over 90 tapes, load hitches excluded) plus 1.5 ms;
     G follows its target with at most +-5% speed changes, never runs backwards and never beyond
     the newest tape (counted as a stall; 30 stalls in a row measure D afresh);
   - the pair around G and alpha from their times. `LM_INTERP_PACING=old` restores the old rule.
   The 5-second stats line reports the delay, stalls and resyncs.
3. **Pairing**: groups of up to 8 draws of one thing pair nearest first without the motion limit
   (it is for particle swarms; swarms accept their own or the common motion); draws left unpaired
   are paired again by display-list content (FNV hash: a list that moved in memory); cameras are
   mapped between tapes by majority vote of the paired values.
4. **Switches stay switches**: draws in a *snap scope* (`interp::pushSnapScope`, LM: the actor draw
   pass `fn_80060E70`, i.e. Luigi, ghosts and other characters) and draws whose identity vanishes
   or appears as a whole and did so within the last 24 tapes (blink patterns) are never dithered:
   a vanished one stays fully drawn and a new one hidden until alpha 1, the console's timing. A
   color channel that jumps by more than 96 levels in one game frame changes at the game frame
   too (a's value until alpha 1). Particles (many draws of one identity) keep their fades. The
   damage blink is Luigi drawn solid and translucent on alternate game frames (Original 30
   dumps of the ghosts room: frames 3590-3650 after a hit at 3512), done with color registers:
   during the blink the trace counts 146 color switches per in-between. Test mode, ghosts room,
   hit at frame 3546, Luigi's screen region at the half-way in-between of frames 3650-3653: mean
   brightness 24.3 / 20.2 / 23.4 / 19.7 with the previous frame at 24.9 / 21.4 / 23.6 / 20.6 and
   the next at 21.4 / 23.6 / 20.6 / 23.4 (mean abs. difference to the previous frame 2.5-4.6, to
   the next 4.3-5.0): every in-between shows the previous frame's blink state, no half-states.
5. **Lifetime**: the last replays' tapes are kept alive until their FIFO work is drained (a
   crash reading a vertex-array copy in `push_gx_draw` was seen twice under heavy load).

### Regression suite

`tools/interp/scenarios.sh` (all runs muted: `LM_AUDIO=0` unless set) gained:

| Scenario | What happens | Frames |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| foyer (`LM_START_APPEAR=6`) | foyer by the front door: strafing left/right with the camera following (candlesticks, door, stairs), turns | 2600-2900 |
| hit (`LM_TEST_HIT=2620,60,5`) | nursery, Luigi hit every 60 frames through the game's health setter while walking (hurt sparkles, heart effects) | 2600-2760 |

Steps `0` is now a **real-time judder run**: no dumps, `LM_INTERP_JUDDER=<run>/judder.log` (per tape:
stamp, finish time, frame number; per present: the tapes and alpha shown, the delay; host-loop
phase times), summarized by `tools/interp/judder.py <log> --frames first,last [--dump N]`:

- *present interval*: mean / p50 / p99 / max time between presents;
- *step error*: per present |du x P - dt|, u = a + alpha (the frame shown as a fractional tape
  index), P the nominal frame period: how far one present's motion step is from the ideal (x an
  object's screen speed = its judder in pixels);
- *shown-time error*: |u x P - t| after a 1 s moving median: late/early frames, uneven alpha
  (also counts the deliberate +-5% slews);
- *stalls* (same frame shown twice), *reversals*, *alpha-1 presents* (waiting for the game) and the
  tape stamp steps.

Test-mode metrics (`metrics.py`) now also report dithered vs snapped fades and color switches.
Test aids: `LM_TEST_HIT`, `LM_HEALTH_LOG=1` (Luigi's health changes with frame numbers),
`LM_INTERP_PACING=old`, `AURORA_EARLY_Z_MERGE`.

### Results

Real time, foyer scenario frames 2600-2900, 120 target on a 120 Hz display with VSync, new and old
pacing run at the same time on a machine shared with 2-4 other game instances (absolute rates are
lower than on an idle machine; the comparison is fair):

| | presented | step error p95 / p99 / max | stalls | alpha-1 presents |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before (main: early-Z unmerged, old pacing; earlier run, 1 other instance) | 36 fps (27.8 ms intervals) | (pre-metric: G - t error p99 2.8 ms at 36 fps) | | 31 |
| old pacing, 0192 | 71.8 fps | 9.27 / 12.69 / 19.19 ms | 10 | 73 |
| **new pacing, 0192** | 86.9 fps | **3.59 / 7.12 / 10.39 ms** | **0** | 3 |
| new pacing, 0192, less load | 99.0 fps | 2.99 / 3.61 / 5.41 ms | 0 | 2 |
| 144 target, VSync off, old pacing (run at the same time as the next) | 105.7 fps | 8.73 / 13.94 / 21.84 ms | 44 | 107 |
| **144 target, VSync off, new pacing** | 101.0 fps | **3.22 / 3.64 / 4.59 ms** | **0** | 0 |

The remaining step error is the host loop's own timing jitter (present intervals p50 9.6 ms, p99
14.8 ms under this load); the presented rate is limited by the replay cost on a shared CPU (host
replay 2.7-3.7 ms + FIFO drain), not by the pacing.

Test mode (same scenarios as before; foyer and hit are new):

| | stale px | snap blobs | back-and-forth | snapped / in-between | unpaired / in-between | fades dithered in/out |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| foyer 2600-2700, before pass 3 | 0 | 21,425 / 55,349 | 163,665 (the stray flashlight cone) | 19.5 | 29.4 | 11.4 / 8.3 |
| **foyer 2600-2700, after** | 0 | 26,598 / 22,642 | **31,913** | 21.0 (Luigi's instant 180-degree turns) | **9.1** | 6.5 / 3.5 |
| foyer + enhanced lighting | 0 | 24,954 / 24,155 | 31,649 | 12.4 | 6.6 | 6.0 / 1.1 |
| foyer, 16:9 | 0 | 16,915 / 15,773 | 18,511 | 12.5 | 6.6 | 6.0 / 1.1 |
| hit 2600-2760 | 0 | 34,293 / 35,869 | 22,092 | 1.5 | 6.5 | 7.2 / 5.2 |

## Pass 4: what reaches the screen (interp-final, October 2026)

User report after pass 3: "dust, completely static objects, many things still judder", with
screen recordings (ShadowPlay, 4K 120 fps) showing a candlestick shaking under the moving camera
and a small extra copy of Luigi for a moment. The earlier passes measured dumps and the game's
own pacing log; this pass measures the display output under the user's real conditions.

### The user's conditions

- RTX 3090 Ti, LG TV 3840x2160 at 120 Hz with G-SYNC on, VSync on in the game (Aurora picks the
  Fifo present mode), frame rate "match display" (120), enhanced lighting (realistic flashlight,
  colored lights, light shadow maps, AO), CRT filter, windowed or fullscreen.
- G-SYNC confirmed from the display's refresh timing (D3DKMTWaitForVerticalBlankEvent): with the
  game paced at 90 fps fullscreen the refreshes come every 11.0 ms (p5-p95 9.7-12.8 ms), not on a
  8.33 ms grid.
- The user's recordings show 22-32 distinct frames per second (08.31.34: 74% of the 120 captured
  frames repeat the previous one, steps of 36 px at the game rate; 08.37.23: 81%, down to 17 fps).
  The machine was shared with agents' test runs then: a second game instance halves the GPU
  (measured: 120 -> 65 fps presented, 3-field tape stamps, the game itself slowing down).
  Parallel game windows are now serialised by a machine-wide lock (`LM_GAME_LOCK`).

### Method: `tools/interp/screen_run.py` (the primary regression test)

Runs the game visibly (fullscreen, topmost: `LM_TOPMOST`), muted, with a scratch APPDATA holding
a copy of the user's settings.ini (read only) plus `--set` overrides, waits for the scenario's
frame and records the display with ffmpeg's ddagrab (Desktop Duplication, `dup_frames=0`: one
captured frame per screen update; NVENC HEVC). Then:

- `screen_judder.py`: per pair of shown frames, the shift of the static scenery (phase
  correlation of image blocks in the top third of the picture, away from Luigi, his beam and the
  dust; median of the blocks; flash frames left out). Reports shown fps and interval spread, the
  position error of the scenery against a smooth path (px at 4K), "even steps" (step within 25%
  of the local speed x interval).
- `LM_FRAME_TAG=1` draws a bar code in the top-left corner (ImGui, after the CRT): present number,
  tape and alpha. The capture then knows which present and which interpolation position u = tape +
  alpha reached the screen: repeated and skipped presents, and the blending check: the scenery
  step of each shown frame divided by (du x the local speed per game frame), which must be 1;
  reported as `|r - 1|` and the share off by more than 25%, and per place in the tape (#0 = the
  present that crosses a game frame).
- `judder.py` on the game's log: present intervals, and with Aurora patch 0197 the GPU completion
  time of every frame (P lines). With VRR a frame is shown about when the GPU finishes it, so the
  display step error is |du x 33.37 ms - (gpu done step)|. `--camera`: the blended main camera of
  every present (V lines) and a fixed world point projected through it (the math alone).
- `blips.py`: one-frame artifacts (pixels unlike both neighbours), with crops of the worst frames;
  `osc_map.py`: a heat map of back-and-forth; `track_bright.py`: a self-lit feature (candle
  flames) tracked against u; `dump_motion.py`: scenery steps through the in-betweens of an
  `LM_INTERP_TEST` run (deterministic).
- `screen_suite.py`: all scenarios (foyer strafing, turning, vacuum/heavy dust, nursery,
  ballroom, ghosts) into one table. `lockrun.py` runs any command under the game lock.

### What was wrong

1. **Pacing under GPU load and VRR.** Presents were started whenever the swap chain let the loop
   continue; alpha came from the time the replay started. At the VRR ceiling (120 on 120 Hz) the
   display falls back to fixed timing and the queue adds latency; below it (the GPU busy: 65 fps
   in the shared-machine run the user recorded) frames 13-17 ms apart carried motion computed for
   other times: display step error 4.1 ms mean, 8.7 ms p95.
2. **Pairs across cameras.** A position matrix whose partner in the previous tape was drawn under
   another camera (a GX camera slot used by the shadow light in one frame and by the main camera's
   draws in the next) was blended between the two cameras: drawn in between, small and far off,
   or snapped to b for all in-betweens while the rest of the scene moved (static scenery stepping
   at 30 Hz in some tapes). The camera-cut test compared b's most used camera with a's most used
   camera on its own, which can be another pass's camera.
3. **Redrawing vanished draws from the previous tape** (fade-outs, and characters kept fully drawn
   until alpha 1) used GX state that was not the draw's own in some frames: a stray flashlight
   cone across the room when the vacuum switched it off (foyer, test mode frame 2603), a miniature
   of the whole picture over a black screen among heavy dust (frame 2685), and Luigi's body
   replaced by a small copy for a game frame (the user's video).
4. **Dust.** Particle swarms (hundreds of identical one-quad draws) were paired nearest-first with
   second choices: a puff whose nearest was taken blended toward another puff; the unpaired ones
   faded in and out with a 4x4 dither (29.5 fade-ins and 20.3 fade-outs per in-between while
   vacuuming): flicker and popping.
5. **Menus**: groups of thousands of identical glyph quads were paired all-pairs (tape close up to
   3.4 s per tape on the title/file screens: boot took 3-4 minutes in test runs).

### What it does now

1. **Pacing** (`src/recomp/pacing.cpp`, Aurora `0197-present-timing`):
   - interpolated frames start on an even schedule and are interpolated for their scheduled
     time (the constant latency to the display is absorbed by the interpolation delay);
   - variable refresh (detected from the refresh timing, `[pacing] variable refresh rate
     detected`, or F1 > Visuals > Variable refresh rate On/Off): a grid a little below the refresh
     rate (116 fps on 120 Hz: inside the VRR range), slowed evenly to what one frame costs (p90 of
     max(CPU, GPU) time per frame + 8%) when the PC cannot hold it;
   - fixed refresh: the refresh rate (Fifo) or an even fraction of it (60, 40, 30 fps on 120 Hz),
     started at the vblank, never an uneven rate (`LM_PACING_DIVISOR=n` forces one for tests);
   - the GPU is kept at most one frame behind (`aurora_wait_frame_done`), so the time from a
     frame's start to its display stays nearly constant;
   - the F1 frame-rate section and the FPS overlay show the pacing ("116 fps (variable
     refresh)", "60 fps = 120 Hz / 2 (frame cost limits)").
2. **Cameras**: the cut test uses b's main camera and the camera of a its draws were paired with
   (majority). A value whose partner was drawn under another camera than its own camera's
   counterpart is placed under the blended camera of its own camera pair (or shown as captured on
   a cut), never blended across cameras (`crosscam` in the test-mode trace).
3. **No redraw of vanished draws** (`LM_INTERP_FADES=out|all` restores it for tests): a vanished
   draw disappears at the first in-between frame (at most one game frame early); a snapped spawn
   (characters, blinks) is shown at once. Spawns still fade in by dithering.
4. **Swarms** pair mutual nearest neighbours only; the other particles are this frame's particles
   placed under the in-between camera, drawn fully, never dithered or redrawn from the previous
   tape (`LM_INTERP_SWARM=old|any|fades` for A/B).
5. Huge identical-draw groups use the range-scan pairing too (menus: tape close <= 3.5 ms).

### Results

Real time, fullscreen 3840x2160 at 120 Hz (G-SYNC), the user's settings with enhanced lighting,
one game instance (lock), 20 s per scenario. "Before" = main (e86513c) as built at 01:31 (no frame
tags: no blending columns), "after" = this branch.

Static scenery on screen (`screen_suite.py`; position error = distance of the scenery from a
smooth path, px at 4K; even = steps within 25% of speed x interval; blending = the step against
linear interpolation between game frames, from the frame tags; blob = largest one-frame
artifact of the run, px at 1280 wide):

| scenario | build | presented (screen) | position error mean / p95 px | even steps | blending off >25% | display step err mean / p95 ms | worst one-frame blob |

(The screen column counts distinct captured frames: frames that differ by less than 0.25 levels
on average, e.g. a slow pan with the flashlight off, are counted once.)

GPU-bound (foyer at 8x internal resolution: about 28 ms of GPU work per frame), the case of a
shared or slower GPU:

| | presents (game log) | shown on screen | shown intervals p50 / p95 / max ms | position error mean / p95 / max px | even steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | 61.8 fps | 36.1 fps | 32 / 37 / 52 (34.7% off the median) | 1.47 / 4.44 / 27.9 | 93.8% |
| after | 35.4 fps | 35.3 fps | 28 / 30 / 32 (0.2% off) | 1.09 / 3.74 / 18.0 | **97.7%** |

Before, the game believed it presented 62 fps while the screen showed 36 at uneven times, each
frame interpolated for a time it was not shown at; after, every frame is shown, evenly, at the
rate the GPU holds (display step error 0.62 / 2.10 ms). Original 30 is unchanged: 41 nursery
frames at 30 fps, main's executable vs this branch, 0 pixels differ (two runs of this branch: 0).

Pacing alone (game log), foyer strafing at the user's settings:

| | presented | present interval p99 / max ms | display step error (vs GPU done) mean / p95 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| before, machine shared with a second game (what the user recorded) | 64.7 fps | 19.6 / 44.6 | 4.06 / 8.70 |
| before, idle machine | 120.0 fps | 10.1 / 14.2 | (no GPU times) |
| after, idle machine | 116.1 fps | 9.2 / 9.3 | 0.39 / 0.89 |

Test mode (`scenarios.sh`, 640x480 dumps, deterministic), vacuum scenario frames 2600-2700,
`LM_INTERP_SWARM=old` vs the new swarm handling: dithered fades per in-between 29.5 / 20.3 -> 0.2 /
0.3; back-and-forth 73,490 -> 32,152 px (46,060 -> 4,722 without frame 2603, the vacuum switching
the flashlight off); the miniature-picture frame 2685 (41,683 px) gone. With the fade-out redraw
off the stray flashlight cone of frame 2603 is gone too (back-and-forth 27,430 -> 141 px).

**Enhanced lighting's lights were never interpolated with the realistic flashlight on** (the
user's setting; found with the camera check below): `beginScene` noted the light count before
the flashlight's three anchor lights were appended, the capture check saw another count and
dropped the note, so every colored light and the anchors stepped at the game frame while the
scene moved. All lights are noted now and blended in world space under the blended main camera
(unpaired ones keep their world place, room boxes turn with the camera). The "after" rows above
include this fix.

The interpolation math itself is exact: the blended main camera's path (`judder.py --camera`, a
fixed point projected through every present's camera) is piecewise linear between game frames to
0.02% (median). On screen, with the game-frame speed changes of linear interpolation taken into
account, steps that cross a game frame are 1.087 x the expected step in the foyer with enhanced
lighting (1.168 before the light fix), 1.000 inside a game frame, and 0.986 / 0.999 in a lit room
without enhanced lighting (`LM_ROOMS_LIT=1`): what is left moves at the game frame by design
(Luigi turns instantly and his flashlight with him, so the lit region jumps; candle flicker; the
light shadow maps change shape: `blips.py` in the turn scenario shows one-frame orange glows and
shadow shapes behind the candles: enhanced lighting's light shadow maps, not geometry).

Fixed refresh with VRR off (`video.vrr=2`, `LM_PACING_DIVISOR=2`) on this VRR display first ran
at 26 fps: the vblank wait for every second refresh never came while the display waited for
frames; the start now falls back to the grid after one period: 59.9 fps presented, 59.4 shown,
shown intervals p95 19 ms (1 kHz capture timestamps), 94.4% even steps, display step error 0.67 /
1.64 ms.

## Pass 5: locked frame rates (fps-lock, October 2026)

User report: RTX 3090 Ti, 4K 120 Hz G-SYNC TV, VSync on. A 60 fps target showed 50-56 fps and 120
was low and uneven, with the GPU far from busy, while "Unlimited frame rate" ran 98-110 fps with
the same settings (enhanced lighting Ultra, ghost/world lights, AO, realistic flashlight 3, CRT,
smooth banding, 4K fullscreen).

### Method

- `LM_PACING_LOG=<file>` (pacing.cpp): one `F` line per presented frame with the time it entered
  `beforeFrame`, its scheduled start, the end of the schedule wait and of the GPU wait,
  `aurora_begin_frame` done, `aurora_end_frame` done, the render worker's submit, Present and the
  GPU completion (Aurora 0197), the frame cost per stage, the governor's limit, the period, the
  mode (G grid, V vblank, F swap-chain FIFO, U unlimited, L original 30), the shown and newest
  game frame, stall flag and keep-warm units; an `S` summary line per second.
- `tools/interp/pacing_stats.py <log> [--skip s] [--until s] [--dump] [--per-second]`: presented
  fps from the Present and GPU-done times, interval percentiles, intervals over 1.5x the target
  and which phase each one spent its time in (schedule wait = pacing chose a long period; worker =
  render worker until Present, where compiles show; cpu; gpu wait), cost and limit.
- `tools/interp/pacing_run.py <out> --scenario foyer|menus|mixed|... [--set k=v] [--fullscreen |
  --window WxH] [--secs S] [--lock FILE]`: runs the game muted with a scratch APPDATA (copy of the
  user's settings.ini + overrides), waits for the scenario's start frame, runs, prints the stats.
  `mixed` cycles strafing, vacuuming with heavy dust, turning and the pause screen + Game Boy
  Horror (60 Hz menu logic: the game rate switches 30 -> 60 -> 30 every cycle) for the whole run.
- The user played 9 minutes on a logging build (old pacing) at 4K Ultra, 60 target, naming the
  moments that felt bad (key pickup, Parlor scene, lab -> mansion, Toad's save menu, doors,
  chandelier); nvidia-smi logged clocks during menu tests.

### What was wrong

1. **The cost estimate poisoned the schedule.** The period was max(target, p90 of the last 45
   frames' cost x 1.08). One 100-670 ms frame (a first-time pipeline compile in the render worker)
   or a few 35-60 ms frames (a scene switch) put the p90 at 35-85 ms: the schedule then ran at
   12-30 fps for 2-10 s until the samples left the 45-frame window (longer the slower it ran) and
   sped up 2% per frame. Every moment the user named had this signature. In the user's session:
   618 intervals over 1.5x the target in 520 s, 576 of them chosen by the schedule itself.
2. **Feedback through the GPU clocks.** While slowed down the GPU is mostly idle and clocks down;
   the measured GPU time per frame rose from 9 ms (60 fps) to 20-27 ms (12 fps), which kept the
   estimate above the target.
3. **Compile hitches**: enhanced lighting draws known configs into its own render targets (the
   depth pre-pass and light shadow-map casters, the glow buffer); the precache built every config
   for the scene layout only, so these compiled on first use (64 MISSes in a 10-minute foyer run).
4. **Idle-clocked GPU after menus.** The pause screen and the Game Boy Horror draw ~0.5 ms of GPU
   work over a still picture; within half a second the GPU drops from P0 (1995/10501 MHz
   core/memory) to P3/P5/P8 (345-1000 / 405-5001 MHz). The first 3-4 frames of the full scene
   after the menu took 30-60 ms instead of 6 (at 120 fps: 20-28 ms for 5 frames): a stutter on
   every menu exit, and with the old estimate a 2-second slowdown after it.
5. **Present timing held Dawn's device lock.** Aurora 0197's waiter thread blocked in `WaitAny`
   with a timeout, which with implicit device synchronization holds the device lock until the GPU
   finishes: every other thread's Dawn call waited for the GPU. Interpolated modes hid it (the host
   waits for the previous frame anyway); original 30 at 4K Ultra fell from 28 to 18.5 fps whenever
   the record was on.
6. **Measurement artefacts**: the `[interp]` line's "game N fps" counted distinct game frames
   *shown* (never above the presented rate: "presented 14, game 13.9" looked like a guest
   slowdown when the guest made 28-30); its "pacing delay ~1350 ms" mixed the host clock with the
   VI retrace clock's epoch (not a latency). The FPS overlay itself was right.
7. The grid wait (`SDL_DelayPrecise`) overslept by ~10 ms about once in 5 minutes; the vblank
   mode's fallback used a condition-variable timeout (59.5 fps at a 60 target with VRR off).

### What it does now

- **Governor** (pacing.cpp): the target holds unless frames are actually late. A frame starting
  more than 25% late is a miss; a single very late frame (> 3 periods: a load, a compile) only
  restarts the grid. The rate is lowered only when a quarter of the last second's frames (at
  least 4) missed, or when half of them were late by more than 8% (the PC a little too slow:
  intervals alternating 8.6/10.7 ms are uneven motion on a VRR display), and then to the rate
  actually achieved + 3%. After 1 s without misses it speeds up 2% per frame, not below a rate
  that failed in the last 10 s. The overlay/F1 status says why: "(PC too slow for 120: GPU 9.8 ms
  per frame)".
- **Aurora 0214**: configs that are enhanced-lighting depth or caster variants (depthOnly /
  lightDepth) are precached for the depth-only target (only), glow-shaped ones also for the glow
  target. 64 -> 0 MISSes in the 10-minute mixed run.
- **GPU keep-warm** (Aurora 0215, F1 > Visuals > Rendering "Keep GPU clocks up in menus", on):
  while a frame is much lighter than recent play, a compute pass streams through a 64 MiB buffer
  after the frame's own work so the GPU stays about as busy as in play (target min(recent play GPU
  time, 90% of the period; at 120 fps 40%/60% caps still let the clocks drop: 69 -> 14 intervals
  over 1.5x in 2 minutes of menu cycling with 90%); grows below 75% of it, eases off above 115%, stops at once above 160%
  = the scene is back). ALU-only filler kept the core clock but the driver still dropped the
  memory clock (P3). Menu-cycle test (120 s, 60 target): intervals over 1.5x 44 -> 1, worst 55.6 ->
  29.7 ms. Costs GPU power in menus only; off for light settings (recent play under 3 ms).
- **Aurora 0216**: the present-timing waiter polls with a zero timeout every ~0.25 ms.
- Host thread at high priority; the vblank wait ends with a precise sleep.
- `[interp]` stats: "game N fps (shown M)" = game frames made (shown); "shown X ms behind the
  newest game frame" instead of the old delay figure.

### Results

4K (resolution x4) fullscreen 120 Hz G-SYNC, VSync on, the user's settings (enhanced Ultra etc.)
unless noted, `mixed` scenario, one game instance (GAME_LOCK). "Over" = present intervals above
1.5x the target period (loads and compiles included).

| 60, VRR set Off (vblank mode), 4 min | 0216 | **59.99** | 17.9 / 42.1 | 10 |

The A/B at 60 in one line: 55.27 -> 60.00 fps presented, intervals over 1.5x 2032 -> 2, p99
41.8 -> 17.6 ms. At 120: 102.98 -> 116.32 (the VRR cap), 3459 -> 74, p99 23.4 -> 9.7 ms. The 0216 fix also lowered the
GPU time per frame at 120 (p50 8 -> 5.3 ms): the device lock had been stalling the render worker
and the FIFO thread behind the GPU. No governor slowdown happened in any final run after the boot
(one during the boot's loading screens, recovered within seconds).

Original 30 (no interpolation, the game paced by its VI) at 4K Ultra: 18.5 fps whenever the
present record was on before 0216 (LM_PACING_LOG, and now keep-warm, enable it), 28.7 after in the
foyer (28 with the record off: its own limit), and in the mixed scenario gameplay seconds average
30.0 (p10 29.9, min 28.0) with the menus at 60; vanilla 29.97 flat. What limits it at Ultra in the
foyer is the original-30 path's serialisation: the game's mid-frame GPU syncs (EFB copies read back
by the CPU) make each frame wait for the enhanced passes so far (GPU 17.5 ms per game frame with
the CPU waiting on it). The interpolated targets do not have it (the game runs decoupled); a 30
target through the interpolated path would hold 30, but would no longer be the unchanged original
path.

Remaining: at 120 with enhanced Ultra the first ~5-8 frames after a menu closes cost 15-20 ms of
GPU time (the scene and its enhanced passes return; at 60 they fit the period), and a rare 37-80 ms
gap between frames outside the frame itself (seen 1-4 times per 10 minutes; not a compile).

### First foyer arrival (branch foyer-first-load)

The user reported that only the first foyer of a session was slow. One cause was a 0.5-1.5 s stall
from the enhanced-lighting passes being built on first use (docs/RENDERING.md, Aurora 0223). The
other cause was the governor. On the save route (file -> lab -> "The Mansion" -> exterior
cutscene -> foyer), the arrival brings a burst of uneven frames. The keep-warm filler of the light
cutscene is still queued when the full scene returns, and lights, shadow maps and the atlas come up
for the first time. Each burst was judged as "not sustained", and
because the window was cleared and judged again after only 15 frames, one burst cut the rate three
times in 260 ms (120 -> 112.7 -> 107.4 -> 102.3 fps). The 10 s floor then held ~100-105 fps in the
foyer for 30+ s, with a frame cost of 6 ms. The second arrival in the same session (a warp from the
lab) has no burst and stayed at 120.

Fix (pacing.cpp): there is no slowdown within 1 s of a hitch (a frame more than 3 periods late: a
load, a room change) or of a previous slowdown. During that second the window is kept empty, so it
is then judged on fresh frames. `LM_PACING_GRACE=0` restores the old rule (A/B).

Quiet PC, user settings, 1920x1080 window, 120 target (VSync off), warm cache, save route, first
foyer (fps over 12 s / slowdowns in the run):

| build | runs | first foyer fps | slowdowns per run |
|---|---|---|---|
| before (0223 off, grace off) | 2 | 119.3 / 107.5 | 1 / 10 |
| 0223, grace off | 3 | 103.9 / 119.9 / 119.9 | 6 / 0 / 4 |
| 0223 + grace | 2 | **119.8 / 119.9** | **0 / 0** |

The intro's foyer (new game) can still drop to ~106-111 fps at 120. These are real slowdowns: the
host replay plus the render worker take 10-12 ms per frame there (1 MB tape, 7000 values per
tape). The second intro arrival and the save route's foyer hold 120. At 60 the user's settings
held their cap on both routes. Offscreen test windows falsely detect VRR and cap at 57 = 60 - 3,
which is the VRR cap, not a slowdown.

## CPU scheduling and transient stalls (issue #18)

GPU busy time (`AURORA_GPU_PROFILE`) in the fight: 3.5-4.5 ms per presented frame (the GPU column
above is completion time, which includes queueing behind the previous frame). The scenes fit a 60
fps budget with a wide margin on this PC; the reporter's 4090 + 14900K is faster on both sides.
Without the thread policy Windows ran the time-critical threads on E-cores for 1-50% of samples
(more while other programs were busy); even all of them pinned to E-cores still held 57 fps here.

Every drop seen in these runs came from **another game instance** (other agents' test runs)
sharing the GPU and CPU: for seconds the frames completed 87 ms after Present, 47 ms apart, with
our own GPU work unchanged. The governor then did what it was built to do, and then too much:
"15 of 15 frames late ... limited to 20.5 fps", and the 10 s floor (no speed-up past a rate that
failed in the last 10 s) held ~21 fps for 10 s after the stall had ended (34.5 fps over that 15 s
window, 47.4 over the next). Any transient stall on a player's PC (a background program, the
driver, a browser video, a recorder) looks the same: "drops to 45-35 for several seconds".

### What changed

- **Thread policy** (`src/recomp/cpu_qos.cpp`, Aurora 0237 thread hooks): the host thread (highest
  priority, as before), render worker, FIFO processor and guest threads (above normal), timers and
  the AI DMA thread (highest) are excluded from power throttling (EcoQoS), the process too (timer
  resolution honoured in the background), and on hybrid CPUs they get the performance cores as
  their CPU set (`SetThreadSelectedCpuSets`, the highest `EfficiencyClass`). The shader compile
  pool and Dawn's threads keep any core. `last_run.log`: `[cpu]` lines with the CPU model, hybrid
  yes/no, each role's policy, every 60 s the share of samples each role ran on P-cores, and window
  focus changes. A/B: `LM_CPU_QOS=0`; `LM_CPU_SETS=any|e`.
- **Governor floor release** (pacing.cpp): while slowed down, once the median cost of the last 15
  frames (busiest stage, without the present hold) is under 75% of the target period, the floor is
  dropped and the rate climbs back at 2% per frame. A GPU that clocked down while slowed shows a
  higher cost and keeps the floor, as before. Test with `LM_PACING_STALL=100,30,1.5` (30 ms extra
  per frame for 1.5 s at 100 s): limited for 10.4 s (382 frames under 50 fps) before, 2.5 s (84)
  now. `LM_PACING_FLOOR_RELEASE=0`: the old rule.
- **`[perf]` summary** every 60 s in last_run.log (`LM_PERF_LOG=<s>`): presented and game fps,
  intervals over 1.5x the target, host / render worker / GPU ms per frame (median/p95/max),
  slowdowns and hitches. A player's log now tells which stage misses the budget.
- `LM_PACING_LOG` F lines end with replay / menu / hold / end-frame ms (host phases).
- `LM_PROFILE=<roles>,<start s>,<secs>[,<file>]`: a sampling profiler for the role threads (stack
  walk + PDB symbols; self and inclusive shares). In the arena fight the guest thread ran ~30% of
  the time (game logic, the tape close, the audio DSP stand-in) and the host waited for its
  schedule 84% of the time.

## Event scenes: models far from their origin (branch hat-clip)

User report: "In the cutscene where Luigi walks up to the mansion from E. Gadd's lab, Luigi's
hair can be seen clipping through his hat" (a brown strip across the back of the green cap).

**Scene.** Lab menu "The Mansion" (`event08.txt` case `"back"`: `<OMOTELUIGI>` + `<OPENING>`)
plays the demo: mansion and lightning, E. Gadd waving at his lab, the gate, then the camera
follows close behind Luigi (Poltergust on his back) up to the front door. Route:
`LM_INPUT_CLOCK=frames LM_START_MAP=1`, `LM_SKIP_TEST` = flag 7 every 3 frames from 1200 to 1329
(the lab's intro event is skipped; one early set is lost to the new game's flag reset), input
`600:START*10,1000:A*6,1450:A,1550:A,1650:A,1750:A` (talk to E. Gadd, pick the first entry); the
walk-up is game frames ~2010-2105, the clip shows around 2038-2050. (The route's frame numbers
shift with load timing; check the dumps.)

**Which configurations.** Original 30: never (every guest frame clean: default settings, and the
user's settings with Enhanced lighting off set to 30). Interpolated (tested at 120) with Enhanced lighting on or off, early Luigi
on or off: in the in-between frames only, so with any target above 30.
`LM_INTERP_TEST=2` (deterministic): the game frames (`_fresh`) and tape N-1 replayed at alpha 1
(`_s2`) are clean, the alpha 0.5 replay (`_s1`) shows the strip (dark-red pixels on the cap,
frames 2040-2048: 94 / 81 / **3906**). So it is a port bug in the blend, not the model: on the
console (and at 30) the hair stays under the cap. Not depth precision, MSAA, vertex snapshots or
the morphs: those are the same in the `_fresh` frames.

**Cause.** The scene is drawn by the event-scene renderer `fn_80114E18`, a `TagCat::SubView`
scope with its own camera, so its values are not camera-factored: each model matrix was blended
on its own as drawn (view space), rotation slerped about the matrix's origin and the origin moved
in a straight line (`blendRigid`). The demo's models have their origin far from their geometry:
Luigi's model matrices there have translations of 4000-5600 units (the demo scene's origin; their
vertices are that far from it), and his matrices turn by up to 3-7 degrees per game frame (the
following camera, the walk). A rigid blend about an origin that far away moves the geometry off
its straight path by `distance x (1 - cos(turn / 2))`, several units mid-interval, and by a
different amount for every matrix: the skin envelopes (weighted sums of joints, sheared) and the
cap's joint matrix drifted apart and the hair's top edge came out through the cap.
(Under the game camera the same models blend in world space, where their matrices sit at the
model; there is no such lever.)

**Fix** (`interp.cpp`, `sOwnInstances`; generic for every own-camera scene):
- An own-camera model instance with a skinned member (a sheared or flat matrix, `skinMatrix`) is
  blended entrywise as a whole (`forceGroups`, the policy the game camera's skinned instances get
  on a fast turn): every vertex moves in a straight line between its two game-frame places, so
  the skin stays together. A camera turn of a few degrees per game frame shrinks nothing visibly
  (cos(3.5 deg) = 0.998).
- Any other own-camera model matrix is still blended rigidly, but about the centre of its draw's
  geometry (`bundleCentre`), which moves in a straight line (as spinners already are under the game
  camera), not about its far-off origin.
- The per-matrix "placed anew" switch for own-camera scenes (more than a tenth of the distance in
  a game frame) is unchanged.
- `[interp] own-camera scenes per present: ...` in the stats lines; `LM_OWNCAM_INSTANCES=0` restores
  the old blend (A/B).

**Verified** (`LM_INTERP_TEST`, native dumps; dark-red pixels on the cap, top-left of the frame):
- Walk-up, frames 2030-2070, 4 steps: fresh 446, alpha 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75: **436 / 429 / 419**
  (before: 1504-3906 for 2040-2049 alone), i.e. the background level (the brim's shadow).
- The rest of the demo (E. Gadd waving, the gate, 1831-2010): mid-interval error against the mean
  of the two game frames unchanged (1.36 / 1.35); the nursery door-knob close-up (hand, arm, door,
  3009-3100): 0.43 vs 0.44, pixels far from both game frames 216 vs 337.
- Original 30 with default settings: dumps 2000-2110 byte-identical with and without the change,
  and 2010-2105 byte-identical to the unchanged build (the change is only in `replayPair` for
  alpha < 1).
- Live at the user's settings (120 fps target, Enhanced lighting Ultra, 1920x1080, `LM_SHOT`
  2036-2056, the presented in-between frames): dark-red cap pixels 16965 before, **616** after
  (background level 23-48 per frame). Before/after PNGs: `out/hat_clip/` (not in the repo).

## Known limitations

- On the test machine presentation never exceeded the display's 60 Hz even with VSync off
  (Aurora's Mailbox or Immediate present mode, D3D12 or Vulkan): `aurora_begin_frame` waits for
  the previous present. That looks like a driver-level limit (e.g. a frame-rate cap or forced
  VSync in the GPU control panel); targets below the refresh rate are hit exactly (45 and 50 fps
  measured). `LM_BACKEND=d3d12|d3d11|vulkan` picks the backend for such tests.
- Things the game snaps itself (Luigi's instant turns, a light switching on) stay snapped.
- Props that appear fade in by dithering (see Polish); anything that vanishes disappears at the
  first in-between frame (pass 4: the redraw from the previous tape is off); characters and blink
  patterns switch at the first in-between frame; particles of a swarm without an unambiguous
  partner move with the camera but their own motion is at the game rate.
- Variable refresh is detected from the display's refresh timing once frames come at uneven
  times (boot, loads); before that, or on a display whose VRR is off, a GPU-limited frame rate
  drops to an even fraction of the refresh rate. F1 > Visuals > Variable refresh rate forces it.
- The vblank monitor (VRR detection, fixed-refresh frame starts) is Windows only
  (D3DKMTWaitForVerticalBlankEvent); elsewhere the schedule is a plain timer grid.
- Original 30 is unchanged by construction (no capture, Aurora 0191 keeps the exact per-draw
  split at 30), but it could not be shown pixel for pixel this time: two runs of the *same*
  executable no longer give identical dumps (lightning timing, particles; 2.4 M px differ over 61
  nursery frames, the same as between main's and this branch's executables, 2.2 M px).
- Presentation rate depends on the replay cost (FIFO drain): heavy rooms with expensive accuracy
  options may still present below the target on slower CPUs; the pacing then keeps motion even at
  the reached rate (no stalls) instead of juddering.
- 2D/HUD interpolation is verified for the GBH, health, element meter, room name, E. Gadd's call
  and its message windows, the pause screen and the ending caption; GBH map/inventory pages
  beyond the pause screen and the PAL GBH screens are untested.
- Shadow depth (near/far) changes at the game frame, not in between (by design, see Polish 3).
- The `back-and-forth` metric also counts fine texture detail sliding under a moving camera, so
  it never reaches 0 in textured scenes.
- (Fixed) Replaying a tape used to start from the GX state the previous replay left; each
  replay now starts from the end state of the tape before it (Aurora patch 0021 replay state
  slots, `replayPair`; from the SMS port).
