// Skippable cutscenes and fast-forward (docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md, "Skippable cutscenes").
//
// Skipping does not jump over game code: the game keeps running every logic
// frame of the cutscene, only much faster than real time, hidden and muted,
// with the event script's "press A" waits answered automatically. The state
// after a skip is therefore the state after watching. The same fast-forward
// runs visibly while the developer hotkey (hold Tab) is down.
//
// Pieces: the guest frame loop asks onGuestFrame() whether to keep running
// without presenting (frame.cpp); discarded frames send no draws to Aurora
// (gx::g_discardDraws, hle_gx.cpp); the VI retrace timer runs faster
// (retraceSpeed, hle_vi.cpp); the pad filter masks START and supplies the A
// presses (hle_pad.cpp); audio is muted (audio_out.cpp); the prompt and the
// cover are drawn by drawOverlay (menu.cpp).
#include "recomp/ctx.h"
