// Start-up recovery and the run log (docs/SETUP.md "When the game does not start").
//
// Each run records how far it got in <configDir>/last_run_state.ini: starting (until the game has
// shown a few hundred frames), running, exited (clean) or crashed (with the error). When the last
// start crashed before the game ran, or two runs in a row failed, the next start offers recovery
// before anything else loads: reset the settings, rebuild the game data (recompiled module, Hidden
// Mansion overlay, shader caches) or put the memory card saves aside. Nothing is deleted that the
// player made: settings and saves are kept as backups.
//
// Windows: everything the game logs also goes to <configDir>/last_run.log (the previous run's to
// previous_run.log), since the console window closes with the game. Linux: the launcher script
// writes those files.
